 i am so angry that i made this post available via all possible sites i use when planing my trips so no one will make the mistake of booking this place i made my booking via booking com we stayed for  nights in this hotel from  to  july upon arrival we were placed in a small room on the nd floor of the hotel it turned out that this was not the room we booked i had specially reserved the  level duplex room so that we would have a big windows and high ceilings the room itself was ok if you don t mind the broken window that can not be closed hello rain and a mini fridge that contained some sort of a bio weapon at least i guessed so by the smell of it i intimately asked to change the room and after explaining  times that i booked a duplex btw it costs the same as a simple double but got way more volume due to the high ceiling was offered a room but only the next day so i had to check out the next day before  o clock in order to get the room i waned to not the best way to begin your holiday so we had to wait till   in order to check in my new room what a wonderful waist of my time the room  i got was just as i wanted to peaceful internal garden view big window we were tired from waiting the room so we placed our belongings and rushed to the city in the evening it turned out that there was a constant noise in the room i guess it was made by vibrating vent tubes or something it was constant and annoying as hell and it did not stop even at  am making it hard to fall asleep for me and my wife i have an audio recording that i can not attach here but if you want i can send it via e mail the next day the technician came but was not able to determine the cause of the disturbing sound so i was offered to change the room once again the hotel was fully booked and they had only  room left the one that was smaller but seems newer 
 rooms are nice but for elderly a bit difficult as most rooms are two story with narrow steps so ask for single level inside the rooms are very very basic just tea coffee and boiler and no bar empty fridge 
 my room was dirty and i was afraid to walk barefoot on the floor which looked as if it was not cleaned in weeks white furniture which looked nice in pictures was dirty too and the door looked like it was attacked by an angry dog my shower drain was clogged and the staff did not respond to my request to clean it on a day with heavy rainfall a pretty common occurrence in amsterdam the roof in my room was leaking luckily not on the bed you could also see signs of earlier water damage i also saw insects running on the floor overall the second floor of the property looked dirty and badly kept on top of all of this a repairman who came to fix something in a room next door at midnight was very noisy as were many of the guests i understand the challenges of running a hotel in an old building but this negligence is inconsistent with prices demanded by the hotel on the last night after i complained about water damage the night shift manager offered to move me to a different room but that offer came pretty late around midnight when i was already in bed and ready to sleep 
 you when i booked with your company on line you showed me pictures of a room i thought i was getting and paying for and then when we arrived that s room was booked and the staff told me we could only book the villa suite theough them directly which was completely false advertising after being there we realised that you have grouped lots of rooms on the photos together leaving me the consumer confused and extreamly disgruntled especially as its my my wife s th birthday present please make your website more clear through pricing and photos as again i didn t really know what i was paying for and how much it had wnded up being your photos told me i was getting something i wasn t not happy and won t be using you again 
 backyard of the hotel is total mess shouldn t happen in hotel with  stars 
 cleaner did not change our sheet and duvet everyday but just made bed they also didn t clean the floor and changed the body gel when we run out of it 
 apart from the price for the brekfast everything very good
 even though the pictures show very clean rooms the actual room was quit dirty and outlived also check in is at  o clock but our room was not ready at that time
 the aircondition makes so much noise and its hard to sleep at night 
 nothing all great 
   am started big noise workers loading wood down the windows stupid room numbering system it took  minutes with a night guard finally to find our rooms the check in staff pointed us in the wrong direction no late dinner bar closes at  am ugly view on trash lorry from windows no information about the computerized telephone huge price difference between booking com price  euros and hotel price  
 the floor in my room was filfy dirty very basic rooms i had a yr old tv in my room fridge did not work overpriced breakfast 
 the staff in the restaurant could of been more pleasant we only visited once but that wouldn t stop us from booking again it might of just been an off night for him 
 very steep steps in room up to the bed not safe for children i asked to move rooms and was put in another identical one room decoration was minamilist which i like but felt prison cell sparse
 we did not like the fact that breakfast was not included although you could pay extra for this the room we stayed in was lacking in space a bit and the bathroom was very badly lit to use the mirror in there which meant getting ready for evening a bit tricky but only a small negative comment 
 we had issues with our electronic key everyday it deactivated it wasn t kept near our phones but somehow there was an issue the staircase for our bed was steep and no handrail the tea coffee facilities weren t updated daily and the floor was dusty and had hair on it and that was upon our arrival that situation didn t change other than those minor issues the hotel was lovely 
 bed was on upper level with a narrow twist staircase no usb port for mobile phone charging not even via thr tv s some sockets didn t work and had loose covers dangerous some corridors were poorly lit 
 our room was an overrated disaster room  dirty smelly hot and very noisy of the banging doors in the corridor and from the other rooms we moved the couch a bid and the dirt and dust of months no cleaning appeared the smell of the gutter was very disturbing the lighting was too weak and a black bathroom is the worst design disaster one can imagine we found the whole hotel dirty dusty and dated to spend more then  euros for a dirty attic room is daylight robbery 
 sadly i cannot say that the rooms are clean enough for me when we got in our room we immediately notice there s something wet and sticky like juice or something just next to our bed we called the front desk and they said they will send a cleaning lady to us we waited at least half an hour and no one showed up we had to go to the front desk and complain again when we got back later in the evening the juice has been removed but there s still some hair on the spot we were however no interest to complain anymore also on the wall in the room on the curtain and in the bathroom there s a lot of stains which i had to ignore the whole time i didn t feel comfortable at all the staff at front desk are very friendly however i guess they pay really bad to their cleaning ladies first you will not be greeted by the cleaning staffs if you run into one at the hallway what more annoying is that i got woke up at  in the morning by the cleaning ladies because they closed the doors so loudly when they were cleaning other rooms and they didn t close it loudly just once but for at least on hour they kept open and close the door i was really annoyed i was in my holiday and i just wanted to have a good sleep at least the parking place was small but ok when we arrived the ticket machine was broken someone told us we don t need a ticket to get in for now and we just have to inform the front desk when we check in we did so and paid for  days when we checked out when we drove out the ticket machine was broken again so we didn t actually have to plug in the ticket which we have paid with a lot of money of course we should pay for it because we parked there but still i was not so happy because i have the feeling that i paid for nothing 
 transportation was a bit of a pain but on route to your destination there is amazing views at every corner 
 nothing 
 the bathroom in our room was a black glass box it theory it s cool in practice it leaves a lot to be desired little privacy not enough light at the mirror and the shower leaked into the hall it did however allow for a loft space with a desk chairs and a second tv 
 nothing at all to do with the hotel of course but people tend to slam their bedroom doors as they leave so if you re thinking of having a little lay in just be prepared for a slam to awake you other than that nothing to fault at all 
 careful they are still renovating the building and start at am so it suits for business people but if you want a relaxing stay the noise can annoy you 
 we had  different rooms here and both were duplexes with identical floorplans there was very little space and the staircase was precarious with no handrail was kind of a pain to have to go downstairs every time we needed something out of our luggage or needed to use the bathroom 
 there is an ongoing construction enlarging the hotel the hotel s restaurant is nice but overpriced the bathroom is not very practical 
 little bit on the pricey side
 extensive restorations works going on we had scaffolding outside our window blocking the view temporary reception area the building is an old hospital you can still see the hospital aspects on the inside when the work is completed i m sure it will be fabulous no fridge in the room well there was one but it was very ineffective 
 our bathroom had an urine order shower was very slippery no shower chair handles or bars bed was uncomfortable and mattress pad was too big and you felt like you were falling off very expensive and breakfast was not included construction and remodeling were going on and we were inconvenienced by it there was a park and that was nice not close to town or museums 
 please see above
 the rooms were cold although nice the room decor was basic and unwelcoming it could use some design help an area rug or two 
 construction on site but not mentioned on booking com the breakfast can be improved it is quite expensive for its quality 
 not cleaned well lady pushing to pay during my breakfast poor signs for temporary reception during renovation
 the glass wall separating the bathroom and the toilet from the room is a weird solution for double it is necessary to darken the glasses much more 
 the only thing that would of been better is if i had booked more nights but apart from that there is not really much i dislike about the hotel i suppose if there is one thing the room i had did not have a view only other rooms but i dont tend to go on holiday to sit in my hotel room staring out the window so not really a great deal i can find that i did not like plus stayed for  nights and this place was perfect for that
 staff a few were friendly and willing enough to help but we ran into one gentleman who seemed to be in training and was totally ineffective every question we asked had to be referred to someone else he wouldn t make eye contact he wouldn t even just say i don t know the answer let me find out for you there didn t seem to be a manager around unfortunately there is still a lot of construction going on so it is difficult to see what the building will be like when finished the temporary reception area is in a very small dark area under the central staircase too bad breakfast was overpriced for a good but ordinary buffet 
 several parts of the building outside are under construction at the moment and getting to the reception required a little search around also the standard rooms are located towards a rather frequented street which gets very noisy when opening the windows this is rather necessary though due to the sleeping area on the first floor of the room being somewhat stuffy 
 hotel undergoing the building of a new wing not that this caused us any issues except signs of building work meant reception was a temporary pop up affair rooms that we had were tired and in need of some love first room had a broken window mechanism and signs of damp with chunks of plaster missing around the window area shower did not drain properly and overflowed after only a couple of minutes we requested another room which we duly transferred too which was better although bathroom lights would work for no longer than  minutes before they went out guess a problem with a transformer overloading fault reported but not rectified during our stay the building is magnificent the rooms we had just needed some care and attention and then the hotel would be first rate 
 hotel is going through a major construction renovation was not mentioned during the booking process staff is poorly trained check in did not work breakfast staff was more interested in me signing the breakfast check although i prepaid the breakfast then serving my cappuccino room was huge   meter high ceilings and freezing cold heating worked in the bathroom very hot but not in the room was not able to take a shower in the morning water was boiling hot could not regulate the temperature forget working in the room no working area feels more like a sanatorium and for all that i paid  never again 
 water pressure in my shower was no existent feel bad even saying that 
 the service was awful they refused to take ownership of a mistake on their part even after being asked about it in the morning 
 bathroom lighting could have been brighter the airconditioning of our room  could not be turned down lower than  degrees celcius the refrigerator in our room was not cooling there was no thermostat the toiletries were not replenished shampoo shower gel dispenser was empty and was not replenished on the second day either 
 the hotel is under construction which was never mentioned when i booked it or at any point until we arrived there we then wandered around empty half finished corridors looking for the temporary lobby the room was nice but the bathroom is a glass box inside the bedroom it s not in anyway private showering or using the toilet feels aptly like you are performing in some kinky amsterdam window there was also a nail sticking up at the entrance of the glass bathroom which i first discovered with my barefoot we woke up to the sound of scaffolding being hammered together and someone drilling concrete hardly the relaxing break from noisey london that i believed i had booked the pictures are of a hotel looking over a park yet the room looked over an empty courtyard scattered with random bits of scaffolding and debris the first floor corridor smelled like they were having some serious blocked plumbing issue or perhaps another guest was very unwell their  breakfast is really lazily thrown together with cheap products and entirely tasteless honestly not worth it get breakfast somewhere else instead we spent  in  days on uber because this hotel is over a mile from anything and the novelty of walking around pretty canals ends  minutes before this hotel even comes into view they will also take  deposit from you in advance for every day you are planning to stay this meant on arrival i suddenly had to pay a further  which caused a non sterling transaction charge on my card only to have the full amount refunded when we left minus the bank charges for this pointless but menditory transaction we made the best of it but i really wish they had been open about the current state of the place and i definitely would have stayed somewhere else 
 the hotel is a little out of the main town but accessible by tram the hotel restaurant was a little disappointing the food was great but we waited too long for it due to waiting staff prioritising large groups 
 service horrible pillows super stiff and big could break your neck room service was done they removed the towels and did not leave us with anything door was not closing and found out on second day that it can be easily opened service in general was poor i would not stay here
 the bar was shut when i got back at midnight which seemed quite early for a hotel bar on a saturday night in a city like amsterdam 
 when arriving i was told i had to pay  city tax that wasn t shown on the policies i pre paid extra for there to be petals on the bed there were no petals the sheets weren t changed the cleaner just made the bed didn t even sweep the floor when checking out the receptionist said she would call a taxi for us we waited  minutes after  we asked how long it would be she said i will check she said that twice made us late for the airport and nearly missed our flight wasn t happy at all 
 i loved everything 
 when you take a shower the whole floor is in the water problem with opening the garage door curtained window some construction
 there was construction work going on in the hotel which i was not expecting and would like to have known about in advance the bar staff we not keen to serve use when we arrived late from the airport at  pm despite at check in being told the bar was open until  mid night 
 some building work was being carried out during our stay which was noisy but obviously unavoidable stairs in our room were very narrow and steep which meant getting up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet was a real task 
 the hotel is under renovation so even though it was in a park our view was of scaffolding also the bed would benefit from more pillows blankets personal preference 
 the place is completely mismanaged the property is amazing and whoever is running the place is doing it a disservice don t stay here if you are expecting a  star experience it s a  star location with  star service the restaurant service is the worst i have ever experienced the staff need guidance on how to serve efficiently the hotel has many strange design choices too had a double bedroom with a friend yet you can easily see into the bathroom shower and toilet shower overflows all over bathroom quickly you can see into the urinals from the reception area loud security doors right outside our room woke us up regularly put the security measures on the elevators ya goofs this is the only negative review i have ever written but the place has potential and needs new management 
 the bathroom if someone took shower because it will flow over to the elevated floor 
 soundproofing was poor could hear everything from outside our room and woke one morning thinking someone had come into our room as sound was so clear service and food in the restaurant was awful at dinner so we didn t eat there again 
 very bad attitude of personnel at breakfast only allowed one coffee from the coffee machine filter coffee was free rude behavior of the manager room was noisy because of dripping water sound heater system in room 
 the bath tub wasn t completely clean that would be my only gripe 
 not being told a hedkandi night was across from our room leaving us with no sleep room could have been allocated to someone attending the night instead of us just bad organisation on room allocation 
 asked for more coffee and sugars only got given two satchets of each room cleaned floor not hovered as the rug was very messy wifi worked for half a morning then never connected again for the whole trip 
 room was not cleaned correctly wine champagne glasses left dirty in the room the floors felt dirty and the shower drain was clogged from the day we arrived 
 the bathroom was amazing though we were two friends sharing and it had a glass screen so it was a bit uncomfortable at times they should think about a screen or opaque glass 
 our room didn t have a sofa in but these two uncomfortable chairs and the stairs was too steep for the room didn t feel safe going up and down the stairs but these are minor issues i would recommend the hotel to anyone 
 the breakfast was rather average from quality and appearance and not that well organized the young gentlemen managing this were more interested in watching the young female guests this was nice to see but at the same time spoons butter coffee etc were out i would expect a better experience for that price 
 breakfast i missed cutted fresh fruits for muesli couldn t find the cheese and for capuccino you had to pay extra 
 the sink in the bathroom was very dirty when i got the room unacceptable the room was freezing cold they could turn on the heating before the guests arrive 
 upgraded on arrival very good but unfortunately lovely room had a smell of cigarettes mixed with perfume so changed room next room in attic annexe very cold offered a heater but asked to change again back to regular sized room perfectly adequate as on my own and comfortable but bothered by traffic noise from main road outside 
 if you are staying with someone who you aren t comfortable sharing every little detail with we wouldn t recommend this hotel the glass box in the corner of the room that doubles as the en suite has practically see through glass even though it s black so you can t be concerned about protecting your modesty nearly all the guests we came across we re british but there was a complete lack of english breakfast tea in the restaurant where you had breakfast what made it stranger was we told them it was available in the tea coffee facilities in the room but only with powdered milk but they still couldn t produce any for breakfast the hotel was also undergoing serious renovation works at the time which didn t really affect us other than when they decided to start taking the ceiling of the restaurant down while they were serving breakfast 
 the hotel is undergoing massive construction with workers all around and this was not indicated at the time of booking we had a rodent in the room one night due to the disturbance of construction 
 rooms were a little louder than we would have liked a lot of noise from people walking by and shutting doors 
 the hotel is being renovated which means that you will literally be drilled out of your bed starting at am we paid eur for a large room but really it was not worth the money 
 i can t think of anything that we didn t enjoy 
 the cleaniness of the rooms can be better check refrigerator regulary and the rooms can use a good cleaning scrub also the floor was really sandy and there was an odor in the hallway and room some extra pillows to watch tv would be nice too restaurant some nice varpet at the fire place would spice it up and cookies with your tea coffee hot choco it s a star hotel 
 wasn t told about renovations going on staff in the restaurant very slow ask to order got told table service then when they did come over were told the restaurant had closed the man covering the night shift wasn t very helpful 
 the hotel is currently being renovated being an old building you hear a lot of noise of people walking by your room or in the rooms above mini bar empty no remote for the tv heating direct above the bed and quite noisy 
 initial room was small but we were quickly swapped into a bettet room without fuss
 that i wasn t told about the refurbishment so when we arrived i had told my girlfriend after a long tiring day it was a beautiful hotel which when we got there was covered in building works we had to walk through a temporary wood tunnel had no milk in our room for refreshments when walking around there was nobody very empty feel 
 maintenance work on facade of hotel no advance warning and some rather inadequate drinks token to make up for it leaking air con above bed was noisy and was dripping stained carpet not very safe feeling a steep staircase to the sleeping area with no barrier from  m high not much useful information no minibar understaffed reception long wait 
 no ground floor room as requested  months ago first room totally freezing etc restaurant under par much better last time we stayed prices gone up 
 we booked  twins and were given  and a double which they couldn t change not happy plus bathroom had a horrible smell coming from the drain 
 even allowing for the hotel being under major renovation works the quality of service leaves a lot to be desired noise of running water coming from the heating system disturbed our sleep considerably no remediation possible toiletries in bathroom had been used by previous guests some were empty some partially used checkout at   hour after official checkout time was declined as priority is given to a tour group arriving earlier than normal checkin time having paid over  for  night stay this is somewhat disappointing service at breakfast was very poor shabby state of hotel with the exception of the rooms is perhaps explained by the renovation works and work still to be done 
 the room was tall narrow and small with an integral bathroon having a shower steamed up the room and soaked the floor as the glass shower panels did not have any doors to stop water going everywhere 
 in a terrible state with builders everywhere we had to wait to get into our room as the conference event builders were blocking the door our room that we were told was new was in a poor state of repair 
 so lets start from the weird thing that happened in one of the rooms we were staying one person in our group got v electric chock which went through her hands it came from water boiler or lamp due to either a bad wireing faulty socket lamp or water boiler luckily the rooms fuse discharged and cut the electricity in the room immediately the hotel covered doctor expences were very sorry about what had happened and send a fruit basket to a room they also let us have a late check out for free of charge thats all of the compensation we had in my opinion the compensation was not that big for endangering a life of guest or what do you think the managemt had a chance to read and comment my review before i posted it the hotel management answered that this electric problem is now fixed but its still unclear if they checked other renovated rooms for faulty wireing too it anyway seems that the management does not worry about this that much since the management said that they did nor endanger any lives in the hotel ofcource the managent was also very sorry in the answer about what had happened some information gaps there seemed to be between the manager and the personnel since the cleaner came to ask us when are we leaving and the keys stopped working before the time we had been granted to leave picture is from bathroom lamp that had nothing to do with the insident but such wireing was visible in the rooms
 there were construction works and such information was not passed to us when we booked there was dust everywhere and the shower was blocked the bathroom flooded everytime we took a shower too dark common reas 
 the work being done externally right now is off putting on arrival will look great once finished but we did get free drinks to compensate 
 our room was a little compact probably due to it being a loft room at the end of the building however the design tried to maximise its quirky layout 
 got charged  for a birthday package when it was advertised for  on the website this was apparently due to city taxes which we were unaware of the shower was blocked and would flood the room after one use we were unable to get rid of the water so couldn t use the room after we d had a shower couldn t check us into our room at pm had to wait extra  minutes standard breakfast was very expensive at  i highly suggest not to buy cigarette machine was broken and staff still allowed us to try and use overall a disappointing stay for a birthday weekend 
 split level bedrooms although quirky are impractical  tv remote for both tv s but on differernt floors a c is located downstairs so very impractical to have to go downstairs to adjust the walls are also very thin not good sound proofing 
 building work starting at am waking us up no mention of building work on booking com and on hotels web page it does say renovations but not that there would be noise disturbance also air conditioning very very loud
 hotel is having some construction work done this i can live with the tables and general cleanliness of the restaurant was not  star all the surfaces were sticky and full of old food the room had a very narrow and steep staircase to get to the bed really difficult to come down i thought
 there was a girl working in the restaurant and we asked her a few things about the dessert but she didn t know alot the staff that evening didn t walk by our table once and when they did they didn t take our plates the staff the next day though was more experienced and very outgoing so our dinner of the night before was immediately forgotten and we had a great night at your restaurant 
 it s a shame about all the construction going on because it looked like such a beautiful place but we couldn t see a lot 
 building work is being done but it doesn t case any hassle 
 construction during the day though not intrusive
 the front desk staff particularly the young men tended to be a bit spaced out and were not very helpful at times however the female attendants on the desk were quite efficient and knowledgeable breakfast was a bit pricey especially for two people combined 
 no limited a c in common areas dangerous metal ornaments on all banisters musty smell throughout common areas deluxe rooms very small impractical design impractical shower design no place for soap poor quality bed mattress room refrigerator barely worked food in restaurant overprices only fair quality overall dark rundown dreary appearance
 there was a loud noise outside my room on the first night like a generator perhaps it had to do with the renewal works in place 
 the hotel is under reconstruction although it didn t affect us overall it s a lovely hotel very spacious 
 there is a renovation ongoing in front of the hotel which will hopefully be completed soon as it kills the view
 staff promised things they didn t deliver room was very small bathroom cramped location generally distant 
 we would have liked to know in advance that the hotel is being renovated we had a room right in front of the building site and were waken up at   because of the noise booking com should warn travellers for this so they can ask for a room on the quiet side of the hotel 
 i wouldnt be able to recommend my grandparents as there are stairs in our room i also dont remember reading that there are stairs in the room although its fine for us as we are only  
 the outside of the hotel is under construction it will look beautiful when it s done 
 the room next to us were quite loud at night time which proved it a bit difficult to sleep on times the bathroom was really damp due to the wet room and water went by the toilet so we had to wear shoes when using the bathroom after showering the staff member who checked us in charged us a  security fee and we were told that this would not be deducted from our bank only held but it was which resulted into the bank blocking my card due to an unauthorised foreign payment check this when checking in and make sure the bank is aware 
 the hotel gardens and patios were under major renovation the sidewalk entrance was a mess there was no mention of this at all on the booking com website we were given a voucher for one drink cocktails excluded as compensation not good enough 
 major construction work underway next door as part of hotel expansion room on  levels with very steep staircase which made going to the toilet in the night a very dangerous experience after complaining they did agree to move us to room on one level food in restaurant leaves a lot to be desired for anyone wishing to have food anything except medium rare despite friendly staff will not be returning cannot recommend 
 the first room had steep steps to a loft bed not practical and dangerous for someone  especially if he has to go to the bathroom in the night second night had a room on one level 
 the bathroom has cristal walls and it is not comfortable at all the room size was also pretty small 
 our suite on the  floor was beautiful but our mattress probably old was slumping in the middle the staff could not provide a board to put under to make it better and at the time there was no other suite available though smaller rooms were offered for the price you would have expected at least a comfortable bed
 the shower was useless and when it worked it soaked the entire bathroom meaning we had to use all our towels to dry the floor was a disaster the room wasn t cleaned properly in a long time just cleaning round the edges the bed room was up a slight set of stairs which left it very warm because we were along way form the window which left the room stuffy and over heated having to go up and down stairs that were dangerous to the toilet or to get a drink was a nightmare the stairs are dangerous and narrow wouldn t be suitable for older people or kids you definitely get what you pay for it was half clean and not very central
 overpriced breakfast bed too soft bath had no shelf to leave bottles etc on building works impact on overall good impression 
 we were upgraded which was lovely but the heating didn t work and the room was cleaned once in  days we had to ask for more towels we ordered two burgers which were disgusting and the meat smelled bad after  mouthfuls my friend was sick 
 we did have what looked like blood splashes all up the top of our curtains told reception but nothing was done about it it definitely didn t put us of our stay and wouldn t stop us going back 
 the bathrooms only had smoked glass walls which did not provide as much privacy as we are used to the lighting in the halls was too dim 
 we had one of our items we bought taken possibly mistaken as rubbish even though this wasn t in the bin no where near the bin and next to other gifts we bought we told reception but nothing came of it very disappointing as this made us feel our other belonging where not safe in the hotel from there on 
 two storey room with narrow winding stairs wet room d cor and functionality lack of storage space
 there was a staircase in our room between the bed and the bathroom this means the bathroom is very spacious and lovely but can be a bit of a pain in the middle of the night 
 it would have been nice if the one responsible for the cleaning of the room had swept up the crumbs from the floor it was noisy from the main street it was not heated floor in the bathroom and as it rained pretty much during our stay it was difficult with wet shoes there was construction site all around the hotel and the choice would have fell on another hotel if we had known this i am sure it will be very nice when it is finished 
 first impressions of the dark reception made us wary to begin with also we were given a duplex suite to start with dutch stairs are very steep and we asked to change rooms which staff were most accommodating about the hotel is being renovated externally but this didn t affect our stay at all 
 foyer was a mess only place to relax was the bar and that was not comfortable enough to stay for more than a drink or two we had a very cold spell and it was draughty the first room whilst ok for a honey moon couple was totally unacceptable for any one over  or afraid of hights the second room was huge cold and paint in need of repair the hotel states it is four star but is not it feels like a up graded backpackers it is basic clean no frills or comfort three star max i thought i was booking a comfortable picturesque hotel it felt like and old school building we later found out that is exactly what it it was the hotel was under going major re constructions to the foyer entrance area nothing was mentioned at time of booking it was very disappointing and embarrassing as i had also made the booking for our friends who we were travelling with very expensive hotel with nothing to make up for the expensive rooms 
 the club sandwiches cold bacon with congealed fat and processed chicken very poor 
 the only complaint we had was the iron in the room was not a steam iron and it was travel size which did not work particularly well 
 there was a little construction at the time but we were compensated with a free drink and room well away from the work 
 building working next to entrance wooden platform to door looked unwelcoming gothic look of reception area checking out at  am wooden beam at one side of bed bloking your way see through glass to shower 
 we didn t like our first room the stairs in the duplex were very steep and narrow 
 the fact i had to leave
 the d cor but hotel is currently being extended i expect the d cor will be updated when this is finished 
 the interiors are looking quite tired and the deluxe room on two levels was not to our liking this hotel was listed as four star though we would not consider this an accurate rating 
 currently have building work in the complex this didn t affect our stay as we heard nothing but visually not ideal when you arrive 
 stairs in our room were too narrow and steep no where did it say hotel was undergoing extensive building work and room looked out onto main busy road 
 we booked a  night stay in a suite on arrival the room was tidy but not clean paint falling of the walls in a couple of places during the first night we were woken up by an intruder to the room at  i went to the reception to investigate and explain what had happened it turned out to be the night cleaner who had no business coming in our room he came to apologise with a feeble excuse i tripped and fell into the door we didn t buy it and asked for a full refund credit where credit is due the manager gave it to us i asked her to remove my credit card from the room security deposit to which she assured me it was we went to a far better hotel and thought the matter was done with no it wasn t i came home to find my credit card had been charged  from them i phoned them up to complain and the money was returned however i have lost about  in bank charges due to their incompetence terrible experience in what is essentially a hostel 
 the noise of the construction works that began at am sharp in the mornings the see through toilet bathroom the shabby sinks and sandpaper like tissue paper 
 the hotel is currently under going renovations and while this wasnt a major problem work did start early on mon morning 
 there were construction works at the front of the hotel but this didn t make much impact when inside however in the reception and all the way to the bottom floor lift was a strong eggy smell that i can only put down to the work outside it was abit gross but once we were by the actual rooms any sign of abnormal smell or noise were gone completely considering it was a  star the room could have been abit neater ie the corners of the room were abit dusty the paint on the windows was cracking but there was nothing major 
 more sofas needed in the bar better breakfast options water pressure in the shower was rubbish really noisy on the road no difference between open or closed windows soft closing doors are needed room was way too hot and unable to turn the heat down no mention of the building work going on 
 when we first checked in they gave us a tiny twin room which is not what we had asked for once we came back down and asked to be switched rooms we got a far nicer room probably twice the size with a kingsize bed so not sure why we weren t given to us straight away as we are clearly a couple also for the price it would have been nice to have been provided with breakfast or at least some toiletries other than soap we had forgotten our toothpaste 
 room  should be discontinued it is really too small and only upsets your customers breakfast okay but choices a little limited compared to others you could add seeds more fruit etc at very little extra cost 
 could hear music being played by the people in the next door room late at night 
 the cleanness was quite poor a lot of dust under the bed under the furniture on top of the bed side lamps the remote control and even the plastic glasses in the bathroom were dirty also something went wrong with the pipes of the shower a horrible smell came out at night 
 being given a ridiculously small room initially and having to go back to reception and ask for a bigger one was rectified politely building work being undertaken all round the hotel the ticket for one free drink per guest issued as compensation only covered a small drink i d rather not have the ticket for the drink than go through having that explained in the bar later that evening if you are going to compensate do it properly 
 the first night we got there we where put in a room where there was a horrible smell coming from the bathroom i raised this with the staff and was given another room however we where there  days and the housekeeping is shocking they do not clean rooms properly but most importantly no clean bed sheets they just come make ur bed that s all same cups same rubbish it s disgusting please note if you are not a couple or prefer privacy do not book this hotel their rooms are designed in such a way they are not practical glass doors n the toilet n shower are clearly visible from the room which was really annoying we had a room where i could see the toilet from the bed other than that it was ok not worth the money we paid 
 i hate when the beds are two separate beds pushed together that may just be a european thing or maybe i got the reservation wrong either way i would still go back to this hotel
 the hotel was in a bad condition not really clean and everything was worn out breakfast was barely ok and room service dinner was bad low quality and cold when i got it hotel arena doesnt deliver what its four stars promise 
 rooms could have been a little cleaner and better maintained 
 the hotel looked abit tired lots of scratches and market on the walls the floors in the room looked a little dirty and our room smelt very bad of dirty drains so bad we actually moved rooms
 the room we were given originally wasn t very clean there was a problem with the floor which was unsafe they said they didn t have time to get this fixed before my stay which i thought was poor no bath in room even though i requested one on booking
 radiator in bedroom needed bleeding but really not a problem 
 location is a little far from centre the hotel is tired it needs a bit of money spending on it polish it up and make feel new again as it doesn t feel new it feels tired 
 room could have done with a microwave our room had a small leak in the walls from where the rain would come through 
 the hotel was incorrectly informed about my room type booking building work within the grounds worth mentioning but is not is noisy or obtrusive 
 the shower was slightly faulty but we told the staff and they will be giving us some money back the room could ve been slightly cleaner in places and the refurbishments going on meant that the hotel was surrounded by construction works but very good value for money 
 nothing one of the receptionist she did a racist comment regarding my accent and my country the housekeeping didnt like was a disaster enter in the room without knock the door a tall girl 
 breakfast was crazy expensive location required about a  minute walk to the nearest subway construction is underway for a massive expansion project so there was some noise during the day 
 the location isn t great bit far out from the centre and area surrounding hotel looks rough the hotel looked out of place there when upgrading to a suite with bathtub extra  one of the pillows was filthy a call to reception and a new pillow arrived within the hour but still not what you would expect room service is very expensive and not good quality or as described on the menu 
 hotel under sonstruction which we weren t aware of when we arrived there was no rooms for us they asked upon arrival if all  of us would share a room which wasn t something we were prepared to do we booked  separate rooms for a reason we booked  double deluxe rooms but ended up being put in  twin rooms which over looking the building site over all not worth the  pound that was spent 
 the change over of staff at the check in too many different faces over  days must of been greeted and welcomed by  different members of staff just at the reception desk that the rooms were not depicted on the site as they were when we arrived the room was stunning but would of liked to have seen that when booking
 the bathroom door was hanging off the light fitting fell off from above the bed there were marks on the wall and ceiling where flys had been squashed against it but not washed off afterwards 
 we didn t have a bad experience 
 only complaint would be walls are a little thin and could hear next door but not a major issue
 breakfast not included in the price and whilst it was good we feel it was on the expensive side split level room that we had wasn t in our view very practical although others may like it 
 they charged all our bank cards at the beginning of our stay and the money is then returned if you pay by a different means unfortunately they charged  of us twice and we are still waiting for the money to be returned a week later just spoilt it for us as we have been chasing our money back
 when i arrived we got given a little card for a free drink for each of us due to it being under construction disappointed in the fact that before i booked it they never mentioned anything about having work done all the lovely garden had been tourn up then the next morning i got rudely awakened at     by work men banging this went on for a good hour or so that s probably why i wouldn t stay at hotel arena again i was disgusted by that and the fact they don t do full english breakfasts 
 finding no car park when i had chosen a hotel with a car park was very annoying there was no real place to drop off our bags so we walked from the hospital car park some way the staff were a bit abrupt not really listening i asked for another pillow in the morning and when none arrived by evening i called reception they said one coming very soon i had to ring again and was told his colleague had been told some time later i had said i wanted to go to bed the pillow arrived with the explanation he was busy and had forgotten i took the opportunity to ask if we could cool the room down as we were so warm the night before the answer was no but we could have a fan i said no because i did not want to risk waiting 
 the shower has no curtain whatsoever so the water just spills over the whole bathroom 
 the location unfortunately were a bit far from the center  min by tramp 
 the fact that building work meant the nightclub and half hotel were closed woken by builders two mornings at am complained to reception who said it was saturday the next day so shouldnt get woken up no other compensation offered apart from a drink token on arrival in the form of two halves of heineken not good enough in our opinion 
 breakfast was expensive and hotel could have benefited with a gym swimming pool
 the hotel is being renovated and an extensive development is unfolding just outside during working hours the noise can be very disturbing the facilities look and sound rickety the a c is extremely loud and not very effective overall the room was too cold what s worse turning it off makes it possible to hear water flowing dropping through pipes in the walls chinese water torture anyone the bathroom walls are transparent and i don t mean you can maybe make something out if you squint i mean oh my word i didn t want to see that there is maybe one spot in the room where one does not have a complete view of whatever is happening inside the bathroom the staff didn t change the towels they simply re folded them  days in a row with no new towels the hotel is quite far from the center and there s little to do around it if you think you can walk think again and take the tram instead or another hotel 
 the bathrooms are more like a cubical with transparent glass not ideal if you re a fan of your own privacy considerable renovation works were ongoing during our stay for the inconvenience we were offered a free drink at the bar i thought this was a nice gesture until i was repeatedly told i can have that drink or that one only a tea coffee or cl beer you might have well not bothered hotel arena it was more like an insult 
 the restaurant food was terrible my first room was facing the garden construction site which starts at am in the morning although per local law is not allowed when i reach the staff he said he could do nothing about it while the construction is actually owned by the hotel it s a real bazaar they can t control it after my insisting they changed my room but the fridge safe and sink wasn t working i stayed there  days never again 
 in our own experience first night we couldn t sleep due to an extreme hot problem caused by the ac the next day we were moved to a better room ok but i was expecting to be refund for the night without proper sleep and we didn t ac was very noisy also in the new room and last at reception you will be told that reserving a taxi to the airport will cost euro after doing so the taxi driver eventually charged us  euro the driver simply said not responsible for promises from the hotel reception be aware of that if you wanna use taxi from arena
 arena hotel is located in a historical building and definitely needs to be renovated on the territory of the hotel just at the main entrance there are construction works standard rooms have stairs beds are on the upper level the space of the lower level is very small  of it is bathroom no cafes and supermarkets in the nearby no minibar in room only at reception arena is hardly a  star hotel in reality it can be regarded as a  hotel only 
 reception staff seemed a bit strange not that helpful 
 cost of taxi to the airport said it would cost  euros driver charged us  euros but only payed  euros from the airport to the hotel
 no plug with washbasin staff did not think this was a problem though i did had to change from ground floor room where bed was up a very steep ladder on a mezzanine 
 the building work created a bad first impression of the hotel as had to enter through a back door through building mess would expect to be notified seating in room uncomfortable as had no back rest had to sit on floor with back against settee stairs steep to go to bathroom at night was a little precarious breakfast expensive in comparison to outside restaurants 
 the toilet has glass walls no privacy the room was dirty after  days because the cleaners never hoovered the room the towels never changed the fridge was empty the room was very small i don t understand how this hotel has  stars the day of our check out we were forced to leave the hotel at   because they would cut the electricity and the hot water due to renovation in the hotel 
 partially frosted glass door into bathroom was both a tad noisy and a bit too sharing 
 room particularly bathroom was a bit dirty when we arrived we found a pair of women shoes under the bed a clear sign that the room was not properly cleaned in addition the daily cleaning was very basic unacceptable for an hotel of this category such a pity because everything else was great my advice to the management is more attention to details having read the previous reviews it seems that the hotel managers don t really take comments on board not conductive to maintain grow the business listen to your customers please 
 taxi from hotel to airport was extortionate price so we took the train breakfast was nice but very expensive 
 renovation around the hotel sometimes can start at   am and woke you up there is nothing inside the minibar but they charge deposit of  euros for nothing in the room they dont have a luggage room instead they have lockers but for this they charge deposit of  from you 
 the room wasn t cleaned two days in a row i don t think glass wall and door to the bathroom is a good idea didn t notice any navigation and got lost in hotel corridors for a few times 
 at first glance it looks like a dream hotel but then when you go see the hotel renovated and under construction which was not mentioned to us in advance importantly they did not hear the construction work but ideally they indicate the presence of this order even the room itself looked like dreams a room with two floors first floor shower toilet living room and a small refrigerator upstairs bedroom but at night when you go to sleep it becomes a nightmare room the doors of the rooms slammed shut and all entry and exit from different sound intensity in our room there really bad in this hotel because of the noise of slamming doors in addition the room may flooring and also hear every footstep in the room above you and from you clean room we had not exchanged towels for  days until we asked 
 would have been courteous to have been told that building work was going on bar staff wearing jeans and trainers is not in keeping with  hotel having to ask every day for milk for tea making in room having to ask for towels that were not left in the room room  no shelf in the shower for putting shampoo razor etc 
 the only negative was the noise there were building works going on at the time which we were aware of when booking our stay and which weren t a huge problem but we did find it difficult to sleep with the noise at night cause by i assume the other guests it was probably enough to put me off visiting in the future 
 not given the room type we had booked and prepaid for no on site car park available despite pre booking of this hotel was a building site so not very welcoming no privacy at all in bathroom as separated from lounge area by glass panel only stairs to bed level steep and dangerous as no hand rail arrived for our prepaid breakfast to be told we hadn t paid and had to show our payment receipt to prove we had 
 next to a larger construction site shocking at first sight but not noisy or disturbing at least not during my stay
 building work going on at the hotel didn t know this when we booked and didn t get a discount monday morning they started at  am 
 the room with stairs was quite uncomfortable with very reduced spaces and steep stairs 
 the hotel is going though a period of renovation and extension construction work starts at seven and is rather noisy especially the entrance area is affected but the hotel does need a facelift 
 its hard to get back to the hotel later at night since the tram is off after around midnight and walking mins after going out in the other end of the city can be tiring but we managed anyway this is not a big issue unless you really prefer to be in the center rather than in a beautiful quiet hotel as this one not enough soap in the room restaurant bar snacks are very expensive also i would ve appreciated being told that there is construction going on before the booking although this was again a non issue except for the small visual inconvenience in the entrance no noise or dirt at all 
 no convenient stores surrounding hotel area had to walk quite far for grocery shopping
 the pillow and the double charged city tax one of the staff at the reception is not so nice 
 we don t like the open concept shower it gets very messy on the whole bathroom floor especially if you re not used to it not a huge fan of the see through bathroom concept when you can see your friend using the toilet whilst watching television it is cool to watch tv while in the bath though the hotel room was otherwise very nice 
 iron wasn t very good bathroom is glass walls so you can see through it building works took away from quality of hotel we didn t like they reserved  on our bank card which was not made clear prior to booking and we are still unsure of why this was done
 theres nothing we was unhappy with
 the rooms were cleaned daily fresh towels etc but the linen on the bed was not changed and had dirty marks on it 
 our room was gorgeous but no big light it was broken so was in dim lighting my stay really steep stairs in my room  was genuinely scared walking down them house keeping made my bed but didn t change the sheets 
 n a
 it s a bit of a walk to the tram station that connects to the city centre 
 no bad experiences
 floor tiles in bath room shower were slippery when wet black coating on glass wall between bath bed room was obviously an attempt to darken the glass tint that was inadequate hall way to rooms on nd floor was too dark gloomy reception area stuffy too hot on day we checked in i question the  star rating
 the bathroom needed to be deep cleaned tiles had water marks no toiletries just champu and shower caps loads of marks around the room of heavy use needs updating
 there was a problem with the hairdryer in our room the hotel sent a replacement but it couldn t be used in front of a mirror just a minor detail really but a bit annoying 
 there were renovations going on that made it quite noisy at times
 the variety of the breakfast was not as good empty marmalade coffee was more water 
 small room in  levels connected by a very narrow and small steps the room in general shows a lack of maintenance walls courtains etc very noisy room there where machines working just a few meters far from the window 
 our room was above the bar area because the air conditioning was not working we had to have the windows wide open because it was hot so it was quite noisy late at night 
 rooms were not sufficiently cleaned on a daily basis i e no fresh cups provided once used toilet rolls not replaced bit embarrassing having to ask at reception for more 
 the only thing our room lacked was decent storage space but for a shorter stay  days this wasn t an issue 
 a bit noisy you can hear a lot through the walls it s a shame the construction is still going on however there is minimal disruption from this and it sounds like it will be great when done 
 service of the breakfast team plates were not taken away had more eye to themselves entrance looked poor given the renovation of the other parts of the building 
 beds sucked air conditioner too loud for use 
 the beds were a little small and very low

 room was pretty small for the three of us 
 nothing really 
 only cab service to airport is expensive compared to others  pounds plus tip 
 london hotel rooms are very small there was very little storage would have liked to have some drawers however small for storage 
 the room for three people was on the small side 
 room wasn t ready on arrival after travelling from leeds to london and phoning hours away to reserve parking rude receptionist to girlfriend about parking as it wasn t our fault someone had taken our space we arrived at   and our room wasn t ready so was given a complimentary drink each and half an hour later still wasn t ready and being told it would be a further minutes just wasn t good enough as we were only staying for  night and had a concert to go to 
 our room allocated wasn t up to our expectations bathroom was to small when you opened bathroom door you banged into the toilet we had to require a different room at an extra cost of  a night 
 the cooked elements of breakfast could have been better but the continental selection was very good 
 the room was a lot smaller than advertised i requested a room on the top floor was originally put on the nd floor they changed me to a room on the top floor only to find out at am that the room had previous electrical issues that they knew about which hadn t been resolved and caused a loud knocking noise once reported to the front desk i was asked to move rooms at am no assistance was offered second room was slightly larger than the first but not by much i thought the breakfast was a good quality but pretty overpriced beds were rather stiff but not entirely uncomfortable i didn t find the staff very friendly they weren t mean they just didn t seem very keen on being pleasant bad day maybe the gym is not worth calling a gym has some meager cardio equipment no real ventilation no tv 
 lower ground floor room l possibly the smallest bathroom i ve ever stayed in awful view from windows not inspiring to see the rat traps outside won t go back 
 dimensions of the room small but i m was a single room and erls court london the space cost money as a traditional london hotel
 squeaky floors difficult to go to the bathroom at night without waking my husband also th floor our window didn t open to the outside 
 not once during our four day stay including when we arrived to check in did any staff member speak to us before being spoken to first we were the only guests in the reception area when we checked in not one single welcome good morning or hello in four days and we were not disgruntled or asking for any special requirements it was a very nice property but that indifferent attitude was a striking difference from every other small hotel and b b in which we stayed on this three week uk vacation we would not recommend k k hotel george nor would we return ourselves 
 the hotel only support to call their contracted taxi which is expensive and unsafe when we paid by credit card they have no cashier mashine in the car instead they called the back office we had to tell them our credit card no expire month and the security no through the mobile phone this is very riskful for us the hotel should improve their taxi service raise the safety requirement to their contracted taxi company 
 the front desk staff was not very informed regarding city happenings or tips fortunately i could rely on the internet to answer more specific questions additionally i was not entirely confident that they understood the questions i was asking in english 
 staff not very friendly did their job but seldom smiled or made one feel welcomed 
 room size too small and it was too hot our window was too small and it good lighting we stayed on the th floor and i believ that room should not be used but perhaps converted to a larger room or storage since the lighting was poor from this awkward size window breakfast was ok but they started taking things away and cleaning while we were still there 
 the room was a little stuffy they didn t have ac on yet probably too early in the season shower sometimes went hot and then cold 
 the shower temperature was changing all the time from freezing to boiling and back 
 choice of food in bar wasn t too good but there are lots of great places to eat nearby so there was no problem 
 the fact the windows don t open and the room was hot and stuffy and the bed was hard it was necessary to switch heating off put aircon on maximum and then of course it was noisy and even so there was no fresh air which is essential
 the rooms are very small we had trouble fitting  suitcases in the price is fairly high even by london s standards and breakfast was extra 
 the room is a little small and the decor is dated 
 air con seemed to be set on winter warmer but easily resolved switched it off and opened window simples 
 we needed gluten free breakfast and ordered it beforehand but the serving was not safe the toasts were but nothing else not the table was set up in the way that cross contamination was difficult to avoid also bacon eggs and potato cakes were cooked in the same oven and served together potato cakes had gluten including flours they seemed to have no idea what exactly it all means to serve safe gluten free food 
 breakfast the same everyday not much options but good and clean fitness center has one machine and they call fitness center small rooms 
 breakfast was crowded at times and the selection of food was ok but not great 
 rooms could be updated that being said everything is functional and very clean 
 bed was too soft bathroom a wee bit small for manoeuvring in 
 the wifi is only kb s which isn t fast by today s standards the power socket near the bed was loosen i can t charge my phone 
 we were put in a basement room which certainly wouldn t have classed as a  star room how ever it was clean and bed was comfortable 
 wifi is ridiculously slow and fiddly to connect using chrome breakfast coffee was only average
 we choose to personally take our laundry to be cleaned as it was   th of the cost of what the hotel was going to charge this was very excessive the room was very warm but we managed by keeping the windows and drapes open 
 not convinced that solo travellers are treated with the same consideration as others for room location in the hotel in particular
 top floor rooms were so small had to leave one suitcase in the car as unable to fit it in rooms very hot and had to have windows open in sub zero temperatures shower over bath tub was dangerously erratic with cold water rapidly displaced by scalding water and no non slip mat or stickers in bath lethal combination for the elderly or children second room key not allowed by the hotel s security so had to call reception to let us in if separated front desk staff very dismissive 
 the breakfast staff were not helpful when we went for breakfast the restaurant was busy and we were asked to wait about  minutes to be seated they forgot about us and we had to approach them about our table after  minutes we were finally seated i was so upset i did not have a breakfast and left the restaurant in disgust at our treatment we won t be back
 couldn t work out how to crank down the heating in the room bathroom is miniscule mini bar was very limited with its choice
 breakfast is expensive especially when i have already paid over  for a standard room per night 
 mistake over payments and noise due to creaky floorbords also it would ve been nice if we were told beforehand that a  euros deposit would be required regarding potential mini bar consumptions when we refused to comply the person in charge told us curtly that our mini bar shall be emptied fothwith 
 the only thing i can think of is that i would have preferred not to have a wall to wall carpet in the room but it seemed clean so it was no big deal 
 i had to ask at breakfast all  mornings we were there for coffee and re fills i think it would be better to have coffee on the buffet as you could just help yourself like you could with tea
 my one complaint is the overly soft mattresses it was not good for my back 
 the mattress wasn t comfortable and the pillows were way too soft i had a neck ache the next morning the room was super tiny we stayed at the hilton bankside and the room was so spacious in comparison 
 temperature in the room was difficult to regulate 
 i don t know if it was because i booked through booking com but seemed to get the worst room in the place underground with no view unable to book breakfast for second day at the reduced price as i should have done it on check in i didn t know what i was going to be doing on check in tea and biscuits not replenished the second day 
 really nothing this was a perfect choice 
 rooms are not heated may be an issue in very cold winters gym is open from   pm to  pm when you usually are out 
 soiled chair in room pillows not clean shower temp control very sensitive in st room we stayed in value for money
 we asked for  singles and a sofa bed but were given a double bed and no explanation there were few accessible plugs for hair straighteners and the like and the hair dryer didn t work to be fair we didn t take this up with the hotel so they may have sorted this if asked to do so 
 no iron and ironing board and maybe a few sachets of hot chocolate in the room nothing really to complain about 
 did book a twin bedded room and got a very large double so it didn t matter too much loo very low lucky i am only ft  
 staff not particularly helpful have stayrf before and not had room serviced so had to request this  times breakfasy ok but not outstanding for a  rooms small esp bathroom and not particularly warm
 housekeeping missed my room one day and although i did not make much of a fuss over it i did not get a convincing explanation i did get an apology though 
 room wasn t ready was upgraded but had to pay for a drink while we waited
 bathroom is really small
 staff could ve been a bit more clued up failed to check my booking room assigned was not what i asked for i requested a double and on entering the room was given a twin so was offered a double in the lower ground it didn t smell very pleasant in the room and the mattresses need to be changed i was advised i had been upgraded this was probably due to the error made on check in however even though the room may have been bigger there were no extras in the room and the tv was much smaller clearly not an upgrade i don t know i guess for  i was expecting a lot more for a  night stay on checking in i was asked to pay for breakfast as its more expensive on the day yet it was already part of the rate i didn t have the best start to staying here unfortunately and not even a helping hand with my bag considering the error of assigning me the wrong room laid with the hotel breakfast could ve been more fresh and hotter appreciate i had arrived mins before it closed yet it was still in the valid timeset 
 weird atmosphere in reception many eastern european staff room cold and uninspiring  per drink of cheap orange juice mixed with tap water overpriced overall
 front desk night manager charged my bill in dollars without permission he tried to net an extra  on my bill with the horrible exchange rate when i caught it he told me i must have authorized it at check in which i had not completely unacceptable 
 the towel in the bathroom had blood on it and it wasn t our blood so disgusting also we had a room below the pavement at the front of the hotel with a lot of noise from foot traffic and their conversations 
 the gym facility is pointless make sure you go elsewhere if you want to use the gym 
 two years in a row we checked in for  days on booking we were asked about early arrival and we noted we would arrive before the pm check in time no effort was made to shorten or minimize hours of waiting time to get our room last year our friends from the midlands arrived for a  night stay while we were there and at am sharp their room was ready and they got in let me see ten days and thousands of pound versus one night who do you take care of 
 saw into the cleaner maids cupboard due to a door not fully shut during hours when servicing of rooms was not happening
 the air condition did not work for cooling down the room we were told to shut it off and open the windows which brought all sounds from streets in from police etc our room on the th floor was small and the bathroom was very small about  m 
 the bathroom is too small and the break fast lacks variety for one staying more than four days i stayed for  nights the cleaners don t replenish toiletry supplies facial tissues ran out from my rom and they didn t refinish them they also don t replace bed covers if you don t ask them
 it was noisy throughout the night because of the central heating boiler being so close to room  if it wasn t the boiler it was something else noisy 
 the heating was not working in the room for the first two days
 i think this may be a london thing judging from other reviews but the rooms and corridors are tiny think small and take away another foot in our room the window didn t close properly the heat didn t work and the bath did not empty when you took a shower very dated apart from the tv if like us you intend not to be in your room much the hotel is adequate but would i stay again not if it was free is the answer
 noise from other rooms eg talking late at night airless corridors smelled a bit institutional
 the room facing the street sometimes there s some noise from people chat but it became silence after midnight 
 i can t think of a thing that needed improved upon all aspects of my stay were excellent 
 definitely not a  star hotel triple room was super tiny not even a double room size we were really struggling not enough wardrobe space not enough plugs in the room third bed very umcomfortable facilities very basic toileteries including only shampoo and shower gel very bad quality not even shower cap or body lotion except for the reception ladies staff very rude definitely not reccomended being in london in the same area several times and there are definitely better real  stars 
 cleaning of the hotel is a bit slow room does not get cleaned until pm for people who like to take some rest in the hotel during the day seems to be inconvenient 
 very small room dated interior the cleaning could improve my room floor had an angle from one side of the wall towards the bed the bed was loosing boards underneath it 
 maybe bathroom door could open out vs in as it s a very tight space and this would help 
 there is no proper air conditioning it s set to heating in october so the room can get too hot to have a comfortable temperature to sleep air con at this time of the year is opening the windows 
 we only stayed  nights 
 there was nothing that we can think of the room key is very large and there is only one they ask that you turn it in when you go out it s a little eccentric but ok 
 there where waterpipes near the room it sounded like it s in our own toilet everytime someone upstairs flushed very loud and sbsolutely disturbing maybe only in these room  
 the room was really really cold the heating didn t work i was brought an electric heater but the room was too cold for it to make any difference this led to a really bad nights sleep 
 thankfully upgraded to a superior room and even that was small and noisy no scrambled eggs at breakfast first morning second morning they ran out of eggs should be constantly monitored this is a deceptively large and busy hotel i requested somewhere within close walking distance to olympia  min walk is not that close 
 the bed mattress was too hard without the mattress topper on which we removed because it made us hot the mattress was orthopaedic firm
 breakfast is good but has some potential for improvements long periods without eggs etc very limited selection of vegetables and salad would probably expect better breakfast from a  star place 
 don t believe there was anything we didn t like my personal choice for marmalade at breakfast wasn t available but i was able to find something else amongst the spread choices to satisfy my palate so this isn t a complaint 
 personally i think the bathroom needs a door to keep water away from the toilet and it will save the clerk a lot of cleaning work by putting a plastic bag in the rubbish bin 
 just walking in the reception could be made a bit more comfortable perhaps seating for more than  person a table for brochures also we found that the area had many good local restaurants which could be printed on a simple map as well as grocery stores hairdresser etc these were in walking distance to the hotel and would be a great help for first time visitors 
 nothing could have been better honestly and i m very critical and picky 
 it took them  days to charge our card minutes before the client arrived inconvenient and stressful to deal with i had to repeat the story to  different staff poor english from staff we cant book for our employees there again
 the breakfast was expensive and not what every traveler would want early in the morning it would have been nice if coffee was offered in the bar for people that werent dining we would have been happy to pay for it too instead we had to walk a block every morning to get take out coffee so we could drink it while we all showered for the day we noticed many guests doing the same 
 why carp when there is nothing to carp about 
 the official price is a bit high unless you can take advantage of a good offer like i did 
 the room temp was a little warm and the windows didn t really open it was very hot in london while i was there so it wasn t really under their control
 the atm machine malfunctioned and a more timely out of service notice would have eliminated some stress 
 the bathroom was cramped it was hard for someone adult sized to go to the toilet or use the shower easily the shower spilled water out all over the floor there was nowhere to put your dry clothes the sink area vanity splashed so it was wet and the hook behind the door was tiny and things fell off it water from the shower would have reached it anyway as there was no door screen to the shower in that direction the breakfast was very disappointing it was lukewarm and the eggs tasted highly of vinegar we had to ask for extra teabags as the tea brought to us was very weak and not brewing well i also felt that the sausages were not entirely cooked the bacon was quite watery the selection of food was on the small side and in all it could have been cooked served better 
 air conditioning didn t cope with the really hot weather but luckily had big windows we could open to cool the room down at night 
 bed sheets pillows and carpet could be cleaner bugs 
 nothing really a lower price is always good of course 
 wifi was a bit slow 
 housekeeping staff were rude shower had water pressure and temperature problems and the hotel has double charged me and has yet to solve the issue 
 ex suite was extremely small smaller then our yacht cabin the week before the temperature of the room could not be lower than  degrees which wasn t cool enough 
 the bathroom is on the smaller side 
 the room was a little small and the shower ran hot and cold 
 room was small but adequate there was old toothpaste under a rim of the washbasin which was never reached by the cleaner even though i put some paper on it to indicate its existence fire alarm went off at  am and we were all in the street for a while all was eventually sorted but no general instructions or explanation 
 fire alarm and semi evacuation at  am little or no direction by staff reason for alarm a guest had caused an electrical short was announced by fire officer for benefit of those near enough to hear no subsequent acknowledgement or customer relations gesture by hotel e g perhaps a small discount on checkout other than being told somewhat curtly that it wasn t the fault of the hotel some guests noticed from the street that a number of bedrooms had remained occupied throughout the incident 
 the room it was fairly small it wasn t a problem for us as we spent very little time in the room but it was rather compact and may be a problem for those who need to use the room longer than we did 
 room was a little on the small side but that is to be expected in central london shower temp was very dodgy but not a major issue either 
 nothing really 
 our room had a very pungent smell of tobacco smoke the blackout blind didn t work very well 
 nothing
 air conditioning a little noisy we opened the window instead
 they weren t inexpensive 
 farthest room from elevator uncomfortable bed air conditioning would not set to our temperature therefore far too hot in room staff were not interested when told about it we did not sleep well because of it 
 room needed to be redecorated as it was a little worn looking
 cost of the executive double room same as our usual classic double room clearly dishonest shower bathroom in executive older and not as helpful as the walk in shower in classic air con did not work so called mini bar is not a mini bar but a bare fridge we have been here many times but the added cost over  a night for fewer facilities amenities has upset us a great deal 
 room was really tiny and i don t think was good value for money but i would definitely stay again in upgraded room as this is a fantastic hotel
 tea and coffee facilities in the rooms need updating and improving the old fashioned kettle and a hand full of tea bags and instant coffee sachets might have been okay in the early  s but not anymore and would it really be too much to ask for a bottle of water or two in a  per night room instead of draining the tap dry in search of something other than tepid water from the bathroom sink 
 small room some staff weren t very knowledgeable about the area and transportation options 
 wifi is so weak and slow at night heating is weak although it is coming from a controllable central air conditioning bath is a bit small hotel overall is a bit dated breakfast is expensive
 not keen on the steps up to the front door is there an alternative entrance for mobility impaired 
 rigid rules our plane arrives in the morning so i requested early check in in the booking acknowledgement for the request was sent by booking com but no reply or notice from the hotel we arrived and was greeted by a male tall staff with a stern face and harsh tone i started with good morning i know it s too early but i wonder if you ve got a room for us i booked  rooms but was just hoping just to get a room first as my father is disabled and he wetted his pants on the way to airport he replied without even looking at me room is guaranteed at pm leave you baggage over there he then started tossing a baggage tag to me and several more the tags are in pairs  to tie on the bag and one for us to keep he untied the first pair and literally tossed the remaining  pairs to me as i realised it was self service i did the  bags by myself and before i could finish he already rushed me to take my tags i can t believe he could be so rude we brought my father downstairs to the loo and got him changed and went out we were so very exhausted and we couldn t help return to the hotel at around nn by then we were offered  room i saw the lady pulling the file from a stack and i am not sure if there actually were other rooms available already i let my parents in the room and it was soooo very small even by london s standard my bf and i waited at the lobby when we were being stared by the staff like we offended them we waited till pm to get our room and of course our room is not next to my parents even though i requested for it when i made the booking and no reply as well and during the check in i had to fill in exactly the same form again with the same info i have absolutely no idea why when the whole booking was made by me myself i understand that they were only following procedures but all these were just very inhuman and inflexible that exhausted guests in every way 
 took several days to fix a broken window curtain so woken very early in the morning by sunlight temperature fluctuations in the shower from scalding hot to cold was annoying 
 not much room in bathroom and room was basic for the price paid aside from that the hotel was lovely 
 its a hit and miss with the reception staff sometimes i got lucky with someone who s friendly and provided excellent customer service but sometimes some of them were too green and not that trained the restaurant got very busy during breakfast time so the staff could get unfriendly 
 the double room we stopped in was a little small but was adequate 
 occasional quirky sound from the floor next door or  floor above quite disturbing expensive 
 the size of the room is small for americans but pretty standard for europe 
 let me think about it nothing really 
 the restaurant changed as we were about to leave and the new menu didn t look very appealing
 i can t think of a single thing 
 having stayed here a few times before i thought i would have a pleasant stay as usual i was wrong for a business traveller small things like toiletry and wifi go a long way those used to be good in this hotel not when i visited this time i ll look for somewhere else for my next trip 
 the toilet was too low to the floor the room was much too hot and the windows did not open 
 there was nothing in the mini fridge it was empty i would have liked to have had the option of drinking eating something later in the evening before going to bed without having to call room service 
 the toilet is slightly small though it contains everything the floor is wooden so you could hear people walking it will be noisy for people with difficulty of falling asleep but for travellers just coming to london this does not count 
 the rooms were extremely small i don t think the breakfast was good value for money
 the room was too hot needed a fan over night to cool down no opening windows
 wifi is hit and miss not a huge deal but it isn t great 
 room very warm aircon was not cooling down the room bathroom very small and toilet very low 
 no water to drink in spa area room on small side compared to advertised twin room kettle plug dangling not obvious where to plug in 
 breakfast used to include a better selection ie smoked salmon more fruit selection champagne now more english breakfast which means the cost is pricey at  pounds wait staff not very friendly had to ask for coffee after they passed my table several times 
 the bathrooms are tiny but do work in as much as the showers are good but unless your very small it s impossible to dry oneself other than in the bedroom there is a lack of plug sockets in the bedrooms and the bar area is soulless 
 s 
 rooms are small and would have preferred one overlooking the garden instead we were over the front door and the flag pole was noisy 
 my room on the fourth floor had only narrow windows at the top of the wall and those were partly blocked by the roof decorations so the room had a boxy closed in feeling 
 the bathrooms ar very small but everything you need is there they were also spotless
 serving of coffee for breakfast had logistics problems please give people a tip that they can ask for a pot to be filled with coffee to be able to serve themselves at acceptable frequencies now for every cup we were dependent on staff not always available and not always  coffee focussed noticing our lack of java and distributing one cup at a time 
 nothing
 nothing 
 above good location
 bathroom a bit small
 room a bit too small a bit too warm with no way to lower the heat the closet smells so i wasn t that happy to put my clothes in there 
 breakfast was disappointing eggs were dry inside not cooked to order no hot dish for vegetarians
 things have changed slightly under new management no sparkling wine at breakfast cheese selection reduced no more nesepresso small changes but these were nice touches that are now lacking
 breakfast was a little disorganised staff a little inattentive decent selection however of food 
 parking was handy and safe but quite expensive 
 the bathroom was tiny and the pillows a bit lumpy but nothing terrible 
 shower head a little unpredictable in terms of direction
 nothing could have been better it was perfect 
 cooked breakfast not very imaginative too small plates can t cook eggs room not as big as i hoped for in exec room king size bed
 the room is too warm cooling is not in use duting the heating season the hotel still uses its famous breakfast in marketing that is almost a fraud the breakfast is not nearly what it used to be it was okay but not a reason to come any more the location still is a reason 
 room was too hot the windows do open but there were noisy revellers so we had to close the windows 
 nothing at all
 the sofa in the room was quite uncomfortable leaving me with a aching back 
 the bathroom is quite small but did have a tub
 wifi does not work in the room its a shame for a big business city like london in  to dont provide proper wifi had to work from the toilet where the signal was here
 the only bad thing i can tell about teh hotel is that the room was just a little bit small not much space to move 
 room was cold the warm air heating struggled to keep up with a very cold spell in london and the thermostat controls are impossible to understand the hotel clearly has problems getting cleaning staff to work on saturday our room was not ready on time having said that the staff were quick to find an alternative room albeit a cold one 
 double glazing windows would have kept cold and noise outside but then this is a london old hotel 
 insufficient uk power points for a couple on business without requesting uk adaptors breakfast reasonable choice but a number of items were cool instead of hot gym could do with an update room was a little too compact 
 dated rooms rooms stated bath and shower but did not have both a dated hotel on rooms but bar was trendy setting reception staff do not care when you have booked as you are captive there 
 very definitely the breakfast fruit selection limited very little input from staff many  star hotels will bring coffee or tea to your table the fried eggs were dry and inedible they clearly had been there too long and had not been replenished the outlook on to the garden was lovely 
 the room for  person are not very big and another very bad surprise is with booking hotel i made a reservation with a breakfast but when i arrived at hotel the breakfast didn t inclused
 bathrrom quite cramped breakfast was ok but not outstanding more fruit 
 my only thing i would say was the food during the evening and this is only because the choices were very limited i am a fussy eater and couldn t see anything i liked however the breakfast was lovely
 the sauna facilities were located in the same room as the massage tables and exercise bikes a little compact and restrictive with no changing facilities 
 nothing
 thin wall can hear everything on the hallway i would definitely avoid rooms right next to or across from the elevators as you really can hear people passing by 
 worst nights sleep in a long long time pillows were awful gave me a bad neck couldn t turn the heating off i barely slept due to how hot it was bathroom was absolutely stifling 
 first night s stay was very hot because air conditioning had been turned off throughout the hotel requested a fan for our room but did not receive one 
 front of room breakfast staff woman was very rude to us the scrambled eggs did not taste good at all very buttery and watery 
 nothing could have been better this is one of if not the best hotels i ve stayed in for it s attention to detail 
 a little cold in the room and what seemed an older heating system needed to be switched on to warm the room up not as welcoming to the room when it feels cold as you go in 
 rooms to small smell coming from shower drain sugar not replenish after first night constant noise from other ac units by the time you got hot breakfast it was cold
 room was too hot even with air con on full and heating right down 
 bed in room  was appalling and needs replacement to compound this the staff were aware of the problem which means i was not the first to complain 
 old building re furnished sound travelled from top floor down bathroom very small
 very thin walls terrible nights sleep doors banging and water running no help with luggage offered dining room for breakfast far too warm for comfort reception staff in morning not offered to get taxi until i asked specifically to order write up on booking com implied  yards to olympia it was not
 bed is too hard pillows were horrible ac didn t work well and was extremely hot even though it was at its maximum and slow wifi wouldn t recommend it at all
 the bathroom was far too small for an executive room the key of my room did not work properly 
 breakfast times could start earlier mon friday to allow for the travel time to get in to the city centre for work room upgrades are not promoted at the reception or when booking in by hotel staff wi fi speed extremely slow the bar prices need to be more in line with the high street prices to attract more guest   for a pint of larger is a little extreme 
 new management means the small luxuries that made this hotel very special have disappeared it will surely not retain its  rating for long
 didn t realise we had to book car parking due to limited spaces available we were lucky to have a space will book in future 
 nothing
 unfortunately there was a constant tapping noise in the room coming from within the bathroom the hairdryer did not work and only found out the morning i was checking out and didn t have time to do anything about it 
 lower ground floor room basement basically next to offices and directly opposite service lift which meant a lot of passing noise window was a view of a stairway fire escape so lacked privacy with curtains open 
 the hotel is nice but the facilities are poor the bed felt like ikea the gym was a joke the hotel bar didn t know how to make simple cocktails
 the room was too hot despite the fact we turned down the thermostat 
 rooms could have been a bit bigger design and decor dated 
 nothing
 nothing really important
 room was tiny and was literally next to a lift built behind the cupboards you can hear it clearly every time someone uses it definitely ask for a room away from one there is a very annoying and fairly loud noise that randomly kicks in any time of the day guess its the air conditioning but frustrating when you already have the lift making noises from your cupboard the pillows are far too soft your head sinks in and its not comfortable 
 a bit petty but important extra socket near the bed for charging the phone computer there was only one for the night light 
 this was my sixth visit in k k hotel george i brought this time my whole family with me and had told everybody there would be sparkling wine at the breakfast there was not sparkling wine anymore wich made us unhappy 
 the room was small and very warm even with air conditioning it was situated beside the lift even though i requested a quiet room the bathroom was even smaller 
 room a little on the small side though perfect for one person food in room service could have been a little more interesting good coffee though 
 room was adjacent to staircase on th fnloor sounded like staff used them in he early hours pre breakfast 
 small rooms 
 english breakfast was not too good and a little cold however they do cater for lots of different nationalities not just the english and there was plenty of choice 
 the room little bit small but for couple is enough in london you spend most of the time outside the hotel so it s ok there is no air condition in the room or it was not working it was very warm in the room we opened the window to get some cold air in january 
 bathroom toilet was very small which is fairly usual for london hotels 
 i filled in the request form to reserve a parking place although the site says reservation is not needed on arrival no reserved parking place because i only made a request lousy no wifi on th floor no cleaning of room after complaining they told us the maid had gone home 
 smallish room water pressure in the shower could have been better
 prior to booking this hotel we assumed you had disabled facilities but when we arrived there was no disabled facilities which made our stay very uncomfortable we will not be staying again 
 the standard room was really too small so they offered to upgrade us to a bigger room we really appreciated that because we were going to spend  days in that hotel but even the bigger room is not that big however we realized that this is the case in nearly all london hotels the room did not have central heating it was december and for people like us who are accustomed to warmer climate the room was really cold when we told about it they supplied an electric radiator for us which heated the room but the bathroom was still very cold as in all london central hotels this hotel is also not value for money if it were say in munich or milan it definitely would be half this price 
 only one luft was in operation during peak season single room was quite small double rooms looked larger 
 see above tangent 
 i booked a night with the wrong date canceled and rebooked for the next night the booking was made within  hours of the stay and the cancellation was not processed when i arrived they insisted i pay for the canceled booking i should have just walked away but thought i could resolve it they were rude and steadfast in insisting i pay for the canceled night i contacted booking com to help resolve the situation booking com were very helpful recognized i had made a mistake booking the wrong night and contacted the hotel to resolve the issue the hotel blankly refused not very nice people at all i would never stay again 
 we were promised the same room we had we left for six days and when we came back they offered us a room off the lobby by the elevator there was no division between the double bed and the single bed i had to insist they give us another room the manager did not want to go out of her way even though i insisted i finally said i would write a letter she gave us a double and single on a higher floor 
 breakfast not the best of choices and although we were still in good time it was barely warm felt like leftovers
 in spite of the environmental friendly policy our towels were exchanged on the nd day although we had not dropped them on the floor which is an unnecessary waste of resources
 it was kind of far from typical tourist attractions although most of them were within the reach of a single tube ride 
  didn t feel that the executive room was anything amazing bathrobes and a larger bed but room generally small we were in   had to queue for breakfast both mornings could you not provide tea coffee for those who have to wait we waited  minutes  too warm 
 on my previous visit i had booked a car parking space which was key to my decision to staying at this hotel when i arrived there was a denial that i had made a booking this was resolved eventually but the receptionist to whom i had made the booking came up with some waffle that the hotel had not received the booking until the th dec  days after my original stay however my booking had been made with booking com on the th dec so one way or another someone cocked up but i was blamed for the failure in their communication poor show 
 the website is misleading the property looks a little tired and feels claustrophobic the parking charges on the full website were higher than on the mobile website which demonstrates a lack of attention to detail the bathroom was tiny 
 room was small bathroom very small breakfast room too small people had to queue every morning coffee and tea not up to standard breakfast buffet was good 
 base in the shower was a bit slippery and stained 
 parking required a degree in physics to accomplish as the spaces are tight but better than nothing u guess
 having paid to upgrade was very disappointed as the bowl of fruit in the room was a plate with a few slices on it and we needed to remind them having paid for an executive room expected executive service as was told no tables for available for breakfast they told us we would have to wait and only needed a table for  not  they know which rooms are which and could have given us priority having upgraded so we went out for a hot breakfast on the first day the cooked food was cold eggs bacon and beans the reception need to speak to firm they use for taxis to the station we were told  minutes to liverpool street it took one hour and five minutes and we had prepaid tickets on the train so could not afford to miss it we had to run to catch the train by the skin of our teeth it would have been expensive had we missed it to pay on the day the fare quoted was  we were charged  and taxi driver said there was no way we could have got there in  minutes i have emailed the hotel manager with my comments to give positive feedback but so far no acknowledgement nor reply very disappointed overall 
 attic room with windows so high up we couldn t see out bathroom although clean was dated a bit s and mixer tap didn t work on shower so water was either scalding or tepid i didn t realise this still happened in london 
 the hotel arranged for a taxi to take us to the station at a fixed price of   it was a private firm and not a london black cab although the driver was very pleasant and got us to the station on time the car itself absolutely stank of cigarette smoke not pleasant 
 one of the staff at reception in the evening apparently has some issues as he was very rude to my wife the rest of the staff were pleasant and helpful 
 we had no ventilation in bathroom
 the beds quite small room we asked if there were complimentary coffee somewhere but were not informed that we had it in the room it was hidden in the cupboard 
 nothing 
 we had a bit of a hiccup the room we were given first as we opened the door the smell of smoke was very bad they moved us to a other room which was lovely
 small rooms but very tidy room insolation not perfect we could hear people from the room next to ours 
 room and bathroom were far too hot even with both bedroom windows open it was too hot
 nothing it s perfect 
 the first room with a king size bed we got had incredibly loud floorboards and no bath we then switched rooms to a twin suite which was much more satisfactory the view many had complimented was rather underwhelming and this from the fifth floor 
 it s a hotel needs little updating continental breakfast buffet was ok hot entrees sometimes only warm often selections were gone faster than the help could replace printer to computer was inoperable the  days we stayed room wi fi was so so
 no bad experiences at all
 very expensive would not have stayed except meeting us family at same hotel i trod on sharp debris initially thought it was glass turned out to be shards of plastic probably from a pen on my room carpet which i stood on as i got into bed staff brought a hoover up to clean but we found more in the morning shows room had not been properly cleaned unable to open window as it was stiff and too high up tried standing on a chair room was tiny and not good value for money 
 parking was an issue and we had to spend time asking around other hotels for a space breakfast quite comprehensive get in quick or you ll miss out on some items breakfast tea was not a brand to savour left it after a sip some guests had also left items uncovered e g cheese selection and flies were enjoying these there was a timid fox in the garden although it was lovely to see with small children in particular it is a risk mobile coverage seemed to be poor and wifi alleviated issues to some extent

 not a fan of the breakfast to be honest the eggs were quite watery also we did not buy breakfast in advance which was good because when you arrive they give you a  off voucher i would have been very annoyed if i had paid full price in advance and the person next to me got a better deal 
 no parking on site we parked about   mile away but it s expensive parking from   friday until  am sunday cost   although reasonable by london standards it s an added expense for a weekend away perhaps the hotel could workout a concession with local car parks restaurant expensive given the quality of food 
 we have been charged for room service that we did not have i spoke to the hotel yesterday who said they would remove the charge of   issue and amended invoice and email to confirm that the charge had been removed this has not been done 
 it would be helpful if the hotel could provide more detailed info on how to get to the hotel from the subway station customers shld look out for the green elephant in the doorway otherwise really difficult to find the entrance to the hotel 
 every thing was excellent apart from room service for food that never came and been woken up at  am by staff walking in room when i mentioned in to reception when checking out they didn t seam bothered

 meals very plain no extras or garnishes restaurant staff didn t seem very knowledgeable cold croissants for breakfast 
 no toothbrush provided
 nothing
 the shower flooded the bathroom and hallway as there was no seal on the shower door and the plugs in bath and sink were no draining sue to clogged hair when we booked via booking com it initially said breakfast included however it was no and actually ended up costing an extra  pounds for two people breakfast was minimal consisting of one sausage a spoonful of beans and  bacon and tomato and small black pudding was not much of a selection of cheese etc just a couple of bits that had been out a while 
 the wi fi was rather terrible my husband was able to get it to work on his phone but it did not work on mine and since i did not get an international plan for my phone for this trip i was relying on wi fi to communicate while in london thankfully there were other locations around the city where i could connect to the wi fi 
 the only thing i d fault was that the pillows were very thick and no options for thinner or different pillows 
 they don t have parking and there is no easy parking available nearby 
 the staff is quite annoying and could be more discreet entering the room without invitation the view from the hotel was quite uninspiring 
 breakfast buffet continental was ok but nothing out of the ordinary a la carte was also possible but we didn t try 
 more seating in the bar area would be good also it s a trek to use the toilets 
 the cleaner knocked on our door at am which wasn t ideal we were checking out that day so no need to clean the room being fussy the dressing gown and towels weren t hugely soft 
 this was my second time at this hotel the first time i booked the basic room and was pleasantly surprised at the spaciousness of the room i was given this time i opted to upgrade to a more expensive room and was surprised that it was much smaller than the room i had stayed in before it just might be that i was given a free upgrade the first time 
 going as a family with two rooms hired in the same reservation they allocated us in two different buildings they were even unable to allocate us in different floors of the same building
 some of the complimentary items of food from the room were missing and there was an empty box in the minibar too 
 a few more little milks maybe as i drink a lot of tea but i was given a little jug of milk when i asked 
 the air conditioning rattled all night and was rather noisy the room was a lot smaller than previous trips but just as expensive a lot better value for money in other hotels 
 nothing your doing a fantastic job
 the rooms were too dark and warm after shaving i got on a plane and realized i missed half my face the bathroom mirror was placed right on top of the toilet bowl which was absolutely disgusting another design flaw was that you had to move the toilet seat up and down in order to flush the toilet the bedroom windows were painted shut which made it awfully stuffy hot and unbearable in the room it was difficult for bad smells to escape since there was no ventilation in the room the walkway outside the hotel room stank of chemicals and the hallway looked soulless like student dormitories one should not be paying so much money for such a low standard hotel which did not even include breakfast the staff were from anywhere else but britain which did not help make our british experience any better 
 if we had to pick one thing it would be the pillows are a bit to soft but everyone is different literally could not find fault with anything 
 location was fine for where i needed to be but if you could find find yourself a little aways from the center and covent garden depends what you looking for underground is about  mins walk in either direction 
 at the outside front entrance to the hotel there is a large carpeted area that was extremely wet due to the weather which spoiled the lovely entrance to an otherwise great hotel 
 we felt the price of breakfast is just too much and would have added another  to price of our stay 
 the room looked straight onto an office window so was a little obtrusive but understand i wasn t paying for a view 
 bath tub was good but if once water falles out there s no pipe to get lid of them 
 not quite the top notch quality it was a couple of years ago although still a very good hotel the age is slowly starting to show carpet coming loose in the hallway wall sockets not eu compatible small things like the bottle opener in the room broken and the nice little bose speaker have the old iphone  connector 
 breakfast is good but quite expensive particularly if you compare it to prices of breakfast to go on fleet street 
 service also they would have given reductions or breakfast in the price but could not because we booked through you had my th birthday while staying the hotel knew this and made no acknowledgement of this not even an extra packet of biscuits spent two thousand pounds on  rooms felt short changed 
 my son and his family were staying the same two nights in identical rooms he booked directly with apex and got full breakfasts included for the same room price that i paid booking via booking com cost me almost an extra  for breakfasts even after i had negotiated a bit of a discount by reference to the comparison 
 everything was genuinely perfect 
 nothing our second stay at this hotel and the hotel is very much in our green band as experienced and discerning hotel visitors
 bose sound system was not blue tooth and still on iphone  adapter advertised sky movies but was pin protected but i m sure we could have contacted reception to gain the code 
 it took a little longer than expected for for the room service to be cleared from outside our room but that is being ultra fussy as it wasnt left inside the room 
 its just really really cheap furnished no seating possibility except one office chair in the room nothing comfortable it is minimalistic furnished which would be ok in a way but you just don t feel home there glad i just booked it for one night to try a new place since i am frequently traveling to london and was searching for a place closer to our office in fleetstreet
 the breakfast system is very over complicated and needs to be looked at it would save your staff a lot of time not having to try to explain how it works our party of six chose things from the menu as advised but no one told us that if you didn t have the continental breakfast you would be charged for coffee or tea even though the other breakfast was more expensive anyway it caused a bad atmosphere over breakfast which could have been avoided make the menu easier and you will be saved the hassle of complaints from customers the food at breakfast was good and it s a shame to spoil the good ratings just for this 
 service at the bar we had to wait quite long to get served even tough there were only a few other guests at the bar variety of the buffet was a little poor for a continental breakfast 
 a couple of times the staff missed to replace the shampoo bottles but we are all humans 
 room on small side for a king very expensive for the wednesday thursday nights first night pillows like rocks requested change and got one soft and one slab third night managed to find  soft pillows bed comfortable not enough hangers in cupboards for  people staying more than  night room temperature control did not go lower than c and seemed to revert to c once room key taken out bar prices on the high side 
 lowered check in desk for shorter or disabled jellybeans and pringles missing only one duck people automatic doors for people with mobility issues and wheelchair users didn t get the room i booked 
 the ends of the bath were very vertical it looked pretty but not the most comfortable for a relaxing soak after a long day but i am aware i m fussy with my baths 
 a bit mean with tea coffee milk in room 
 tray charge too expensive putting us off ordering food smart tv did not seem to work well but none of these issues detracted from a comfortable and enjoyable stay 
 we got a room  with a very disappointing view we were looking right into the balconies of other rooms the room itself did not have a balcony especially in summer you won t have much privacy location temple is very central but still i would chose another central location the next time i m in london as in the weekends temple seems a bit deserted 
  the hair dryer can not be used in the bathroom and that i can understand but then the plug in the room should be closer to the mirror or at least to have a larger hair dryer electric cord because i could not see myself in the mirror whilst i was drying my hair so basically the hotel has have  options larger hair dryer electric cord electric plug closer to the mirror mirror on both sides of the tv  another small comment the shower mat had dessapeared the second night i guess by mistake it was removed and not replaced 
 can t think of anything that could have been improved 
 the fire alarm went off in the middle of the night which was a bit disorientating pretty sure this isn t regular but there you go 
 sorry can t think of any negative thing 
 how hasn t this place got a extra star it should be five star not four 
 really we could find fault with nothing 
 the basin doesn t seem to be clean enough it s difficult to drain waters down the basin
 the shower was half clean the window curtain and the window were dirty 
 could have had a few more different tea bags in room 
 as always the price of breakfast is far too expensive there are several places nearby to eat at sensible prices 
 we heard our neighbors bathroom in the night
 just loved it 
 in the early morning my sleep was interrupted by the buzzer from the speaker on the desk i didn t know what happened the air conditioning didn t keep in a right temperature 
 hard to find the taxi entrance so getting the bags down the stairs is a bit tricky but the staff are happy to help 
 all is not good breakfast expensive bed horrible and water is not hot for shower likewise bedroom was not clean 
 we didn t take the overpriced breakfast instead we went to a cafe a few steps away 
 the rooms and corridors were much to hot however i was able to lower the temperature in the room there is absolutely nothing else to complain about a lovely hotel
 there wasn t a full length mirror in the room we were going to an event and could have done with it in addition a magnifying mirror to put on eye makeup 
 unfortunately the safe wouldn t unlock they tried drilling it for   hour couldn t stand anymore told them to take it away which they did and returned me the contents but had no other safe available i did get a breakfast for my daughter husband and me free 
 wardrobe was not so big but ours room had a nice sofa zone that we use to leave stuff so in the end was all ok
 i realise that good accommodation is expensive in central london but neverthelessi feel this hotel is somewhat costly we were on a room only rate so i cannot comment on the breakfasts or dinners but breakfasts are readily available within a short stroll of the hotel 
 just a little pricey would have liked to spend an extra day maybe need to book very early to get a good deal 
 we didn t have a very good experience in the restaurant because of a problem in the kitchen half of the set menu was unavailable and no alternative was offered service was very slow one hour and a half for  burger  risotto and  pies 
 i can t think of anything that could have been improved 
 all minor issues the location of the room was good however i did expect to have both a shower and a bath in the room when we checked in we had a choice of either bath or shower not both which wasn t a massive deal there was also a note to say what was complimentary however there were a few of the items missing also in the morning three times our door was knocked for the room to be cleaned well before check out time one opened the door to come into our room while we were still in bed sleeping 
 the food we ordered in the hotel restaurant wasn t available we had to venture out to eat instead 
 several options on evening menu not available even ran out of chips 
 the smart tv wasn t connected to the internet so i couldn t connect my phone to tablet to it which kind of defeats the point of having a smart tv also the view from the room was pretty much just the wall which ran alongside the building but on the ground floor you shouldn t really expect much else 
 really couldn t fault it 
 we brought friends to dinner and discovered very limited choice on the menu although we were compensated 
 room smelt a little smokey and the towels didn t smell fresh slightly musty my in room breakfast pancakes went so hard i couldn t cut them which makes me think they were zapped to make them hot 
 was not told about the  extra per night they charged you get it back at the end of your stay but does not go back into your bank for a few days this needs to be brought to people s attention before they arrive 
 while some staff were outstanding and performed very well e g jesus other staff were just rude to the level that i will not recommend this hotel to any of my network 
 we chose to decline the breakfast as it was overpriced and london has so much more to offer when it comes to food pillows were too chunky
 all good 
 i didn t understand the continental breakfast setup my room didn t include breakfast a weetabix and pastry and tea ended up costing  pounds 
 no full length mirror in bedrooms breafast quality could have been better servuce was lacking
 being really really picky here more space on desk to lay out cosmetics to sit and do make up in comfort rather than using bathroom mirror 
 room was too hot even with air con as could only put down to  degrees 
 i bought drinks at the bar not waiter service and they still tried to add the  service charge they were not happy when i queried it and asked for the money back light lunch snacks were very average and overpriced
 maybe a bit more choice for the breakfast but you already have eggs as you want them 
 in an ideal world the hotel would be a bit closer to the tube station although it was only a  minute walk away 
 we were put in a disabled room so no bath 
 check in lady was quite abrupt and that s the first impression spoiled instantly double room was booked via this site and but got told on arrival not advised that there are no double beds available and i will have to have room with two singles disappointment number two and hope for comfy sleep gone ac unit in the room was making very loud clicking noise faulty stat occasionally bose docking station only suitable for iphone  do those still exist there was a sign about the bath mat in the bathroom but no bath mat at this price range it was somewhat disappointing experience 
 my room was opposite the lifts and was quite noisy which wasn t ideal when trying to work would have been good if there was a sliding door in between the entry area and bedroom so it could be closed to minimise outside sounds 
 the heating was turned to  degrees in the room when we checked in so it was a bit warm 
 there was no bubble bath
 room facing a wall 
 i was disappointed that there no sofa or armchir in the room as depicts in the room description the view offices  meter from my window the price of room service
 need to put more milk and tea bags in the room but i find that problem during most of my stays in hotels the room was clean but there was a couple of hairs in the bath probably from the cleaner i didn t make a fuss and just washed them away you could tell the room was spotless everywhere else and it was just a mistake the bath had been cleaned 
 nothing 
 was difficult to see from afar where hotel is had to literally be up close to realise yoi were at the right place 
 in the area around the hotel there was nowhere open for breakfast at all when we asked why its because it is mainly a commuter working area so we ended up not being able to get any breakfast not the apex hotels fault may i add advice would be if you have plans near the hotel definitely book breakfast at the apex the concierge was also a little rude and unhelpful not a big issue nor is that the hotels fault 
 room isn t as photo shows in booking we booked superior king room with balcony descprtion photo shows room size m with sofa we were given a room on  floor the room was small abt  m only one bed with little standing space beside bed no sofa balcony not like photo shown where u can have dinner there this balcony only had standing space 
 one staff member on reception was a bit trite when queried why photo id was required for a second time after checking in earlier in the day 
 the ac couldn t keep the room cool during the day even with the shades down about   of the tv channels didn t work due to weak signal only one elevator bank for guests it s a walk from the higher number rooms there are other lifts but they re staff only 
 nothing
 there really wasn t anything to dislike about this hotel 
 regular customer of apex city of london hotel they didn t know i was a returning customer upon arrival breakfast should have been included for over  for a room 
 the room that i was given is smaller than what was shown when i reserved online and they immediately ask you to upgrade and pay more to get the bigger one the room view was to corporate offices so i couldn t open the windows no privacy inside the room because and because of that it was always lights on mode 
 the room was warm overnight despite the aircon being set to the lowest possible temperature 
 the restaurant was not big enough to cope with demand so we had to wait for a table to become free
 staff wasn t super friendly doorman was impatient and bordering on rude 
 no decaff tea bags and only one packet of biscuits in the room 
 seemed very matter of fact at reception lacked warmth didn t like smokers on balcony next to mine 
 location was ok but a lot of places were shut at weekend so there wasn t too much right on the doorstep 
 oddly i was placed in a disabled room but not a problem and nice to see that they have great facilities for those who may be less mobile 
 nothing
 nothing 
 it was an excellent hotel all round nothing to complain about 
 we had an evening meal and the menu hadn t changed since our last visit 
 the noise and souproof in general specially from the inside the entrance door too close from the bed
 breakfast was chaotic slow and had to keep on asking for missing items definitely the b team on that day was better in previous stay 
 the really long and winding corridor leading to my room being a single person it was a bit spooky walking to the room late in the evening 
 booked a room for  and were told it would be a sofa bed didn t expect to be as comfy as a bed but also didn t expect it to be excruciatingly uncomfortable no sleep in preparation for a long drive home also didn t notice we had no bedding for the sofa bed until we were all ready for bed at quite a late hour and then had to wait for it to be brought up a bit disappointing after a long day 
 enjoyed it all 
 only  small bottle of water left per day and our room never had the complimentary snacks pringles and jelly beans during our  night stay 
 when we booked the photos saw a couch in the room our room didn t have one actually this was not a problem i prefer to have more empty space also there are no smoking rooms in this hotel and while this might be great for most visitors since i am travelling very often to london it will be a problem for me during winter months 
 none
 staff in reception not helpful nore friendly besides we had to wait  minutes to get a drink at the bar the waiter never came we had to go to the bar poor service compared to the hotel ranking
 nothing to improve wish i could ve stayed longer 
 we chose this expensive hotel because the photos on booking com seemed to show a rooftop restaurant with views over london and were really looking forward to sitting there in the evening for a meal when we arrived we were told there was no such roof restaurant although they admitted they had previously had other guests who had expected the same the restaurant was indoors on the ground floor and adjoining courtyard on the ground floor the photos we had seen were of the terrace of one of the penthouse suites showing tables chairs and food we were really disappointed and felt the advertising had been misleading 
 nothing
 the coffee was a bit weak but this is a small shortcoming in context 
 staff were rude and not very pleasant to deal with at reception i also called in house service for a cup as we were only given one in our room i spoke to a very rude man who told me to call housekeeping but didn t give me an extension number once i called reception they said they would called in house service but i still didn t receive the cup perhaps this individual member of staff mentioned above begrudgingly didn t feel it was his duty p also used the public computers at the reception but the printers didn t work not much point of them being there in my view or perhaps just do some maintenance in summary great stay and i would stay again but a reminder to hotel that a smile goes a long way 
 area very quiet on weekends some shops closed as financial area but still only   mins walk to convent garden only issue with the room was that it was a few minutes walk from reception get a room on the side above the reception 
 located in the business district thus a fair distance walk from most attractions and restaurants limited view
 can t think of anything we were so pleased with everything
 very poor front desk service the morning we left we did not receive the wake up call we ordered and were very late leaving for the airport i attempted to get help from front desk staff who were very uninformed about transportation options to heathrow a very basic piece of knowledge for hotel staff in london we ended up with a taxi that took   hours due to a bike race nobody at the hotel seemed aware of this either and cost about  if you re not from london be aware that this hotel is in more of a business district many of the surrounding restaurants and shops were closed on saturday we walked to covent garden for pretty much everything 
 can t find fault with anything loved it 
 room was not ready for us to check in the front desk staff who dealt with us were cold and impersonal no sense of personal individualised service 
 access to the bar was difficult as there were some corporate events understandable considering the quality of the hotel so not really a low point just a minor inconvenience
 accessibility is terrible in the hotel we have a baby buggy and it was nightmare for us to enter and exit from hotel no ramps lots of steps hotel is very big and room corridors are like a maze there is only one lift the other one next to it is broken and not fixed in  days on the hotel you have go long way on maze like corridors front desk was also very rude on check in i had a problem with my credit card and the staff was not helpful and acted very rude
 housekeeping didn t wash used cups didn t change duvet cover was clean on arrival dropped spoon and made a coffee stain 
 milk had gone off in room facility plus only one packet of biscuits between us staff seemed unable to activate second keycard for room and only one pair of complementary slippers instead of two not enough vegetarian options on the restaurant menu 
 as above
 two adjacent rooms were requested upon arrival only one was ready 
 room looked over by office block strong smell of cleaning fluid in the room staff gave us another room without hesitation
 location for me but it is still very central 
 a bit mean with tea coffee milk etc the only outside seating area was very busy we couldn t get a table in the evening 
 nothing
 bar and food prices but then it is london and the whole city is a rip off 
 it would be nice if the waiter who brings the breakfast to the room was as friendly as all the other staff 
 the lighting was pretty dark room lighting would go a long way instead of a lamp 
 entering the hotel involved crossing an open courtyard and negotiating a number of steps as it was raining when we arrived we got wet and it was uncomfortable having to carry suitcases up and down steps 
 they gave me the barrier free room which was not as comfortable as expected view on a wracked street corner so i felt a bit disappointed in view of the rather high price 
 details of the restaurant menus in the room might have encouraged us to use these as it was we ate out 
 nothing could be better everything was excellent
 skimpy with the tea biscuits coffee tray no opening window bit pricey compared with other similar london stays 
 nothing at all
 we had to change rooms which was easily done and quickly without a hassle because the air conditioning was not working 
 nothing to complain about here 
 cannot think of anything
 my self and my wife came to london for a weekend birthday celebration on arrival one of your staff members rudely asked us for our passports just because we look asian we were both born in the uk and explained this she then carried on asking us for our passports even after we told her we have british passports she then asked how long we have been in the country very very rude discriminatory spoilt our weekend we have used holiday inn many times before but will never use it again we feel very strongly about this will be submitting a formal complaint online review regards mr surj dhami 
 the place is designed by someone who thinks design is more important than comfort by the end of the trip i found the walk along the very long corridor to my room was almost painful the room was ridiculously dark it was a big room but with one small window for that reason alone i would never stay there again the air conditioning could not be turned low enough to make a difference almost every night i was woken up because it was too hot to sleep even on top of the bed the staff did not say hello to me once and i was there for five nights the cost was extortionate given the pleasantness of the facility but it was then suggested to me that i had taken things out of the minibar which was untrue not to be repeated 
 kippers they forgot our order and when they came they were very small and dry try loch fyne kippers best not to have kippers on the menu if they are not up to standard 
 only tiny issue the internet was slow and the firewall prevented me from remote access to my server which was based in london not that far away so that was a major inconvenience as on my last day i had to work 
 bar prices but that s london for you 
 can t really think of anything
 for  days straight i found the staff dumped my cloths on the floor luckily with the cloth clean bag the room cleaning did not reach the standard level of services 
 laundry dry cleaning rates whilst service and product is excellent the cost seems much too high 
 nothing
 the breakfast and drinks at the bar were quite expensive we went to a place around the corner and got breakfast for  people for under the cost of  person at the hotel
 too little wardrobe space no chest of drawers in the room only two very small drawers lighting in the bathroom could have been better no where to put toiletries in the shower
 absolutely nothing
 expensive breakfast stairs in front of the hotel made it very inconvenient to disabled people and guests with heavier luggage
 did not have enough time to appreciate all of the hotel facilities 
 no fox news or cnbc on tv these are important channels for us visitors big selection of international channels from other countries wish there was ice machine on floor for convenience
 there was a bit of a wait for some at breakfast this is being super picky though as genuinely hard to find any fault at all 
 the breakfast was expensive but we wanted to explore and so brunched out while we were there 
 we asked for an invoice of the stay on departure and was told it would be emailed to us days later still nothing so i called the hotel and asked again they repeated my email to me and said it would be done right away  weeks later still nothing at all i think they ve over charged me for something and with them not wanting to get caught out that s why their withholding the details of my bill 
 i sleep warm and i couldn t get the room cool enough but that s minor 
 all good 
 there wasn t anything we didn t like 
 i stayed on a sunday night and paid a very good rate for this quality of hotel but expensive during the week 
 i couldn t fault it at all
 there was nothing to fault 
 the only down point i have on the hotel is the heat in the room at times was very very high i understand the weekend we visited london was very warm but the air con could be reviewed to allow lower temperatures 
 i found the breakfast a bit too expensive but the service was great 
 limited views but not an issue for us as it s not located for that and we were out most of the day and evening 
 nothing everything was spot on 
 breakfast was very expensive
 am struggling to think of any negatives in fact i cannot think of any at all 
 bar prices a little steep 
 breakfast prices might be reduced
 when staying in a deluxe room guests have use of the club lounge except in our case due to the free upgrade i thought this was a bit mean spirited also we were awoken at  am on our last morning by maintenance but reception staff were unsure why however they offered us a free upgrade with their sincere apologies the next time we book with them
 none
 the wash basin in our bathroom was obviously partially blocked and took several minutes to drain it wasn t a major problem and we reported it on departure whilst the restaurant was fine for breakfast it looked rather boring for dinner so we ate out every night 
 nothing 
 wifi was weak needed a comfy chair in the bedroom needed adjustable lighting so you don t disturb each other room looked out onto walls windows of other rooms dark and no view at all 
 no complaints
 bed could be a little softer possibly with a topper 
 was approx  minute walk to closest tube station because its equally distanced between temple and black friars stations could just be me being lazy though 
 view the views featured in the glossy information where not visible from our rooms one had an ok view of the courtyard area but he other was the view of an unfished building project not much else 
 n a
 over priced it is a nice hotel but facilities and offering is not validating price charged this time i was lucky and get very good offer on the price via booking com i will be coming back every time when i m able to secure such price breakfast is disappointing 
 absolutely nothing
 booked without breakfast but decided in the evening to opt for breakfast were told when we booked in we could pre order any time but when we went to the desk in the evening we were told we should have ordered it when we booked in and that it was too late now to get the special offer so we ended up having to pay the full price conflicting information from the staff 
 food drink was delicious but a little pricey
 there is absolutely nothing that we didn t like 
 the breakfast is expensive 
 room did get very hot during the night had to get up to put on air con wifi is not super speed as stated in fact i couldn t log on at all for our two night stay 
 an extra  charge i m still to work out for what the additonal  wasn t on my receipt at checkout would be very disappointed to learn an additonal charge had been added for the  mins or so we went into the club lounge upon checkout especially when we thought it was very hospitable of them to let us gather our thoughts as we were rushing at checkout 
 my one experience in the dining room was not great i ordered a cheese omelette server brought ham omelette horrifying this vegetarian 
 all night menu could have had better quality choices 
 would have liked an easter duck to go with our christmas duck parking is quite a distance from the hotel however very good rate would be nice to have the option of valet parking 
 breakfast was great but wasn t buffet style which i prefer but that s the only minimal thing i could think of everything else was amazing and would recommend this highly
 nothing could be improved our stay was excellent 
 breakfast staff were aloof and unhelpful 
 there is nothing i would criticise the hotel for 
 the only thing for us was the location as we are not familiar with london we found it quite difficult to find other than that we couldn t have asked for anything better 
 nothing of note 
 room backed into another building and thoroughfare lack of privacy so had to keep the curtain closed
 elephant wonderful but the cow is not needed 
 the bin men came a little later on a sunday morning but hey we were in central london its noisier in  hotels certainly not the hotels fault 
  hour bar service would be good but i can t really fault anything we had a brilliant stay 
 it would be nice if it was a bit cheaper 
 there is a definite problem with the smoking ban for those who smoke one has to walk all the way through those corridors to smoke outside there has to be a better option available either a special smoking area inside the hotel or the availability of rooms for smokers 
 room not set up well for using mirror at desk for make up hair as poorly lit and too far from sockets to use blow dryer provided in room since staying over for a night out with friends these little things would have been nice 
 did not take breakfast but expensive
 nothing 
 too hot everywhere air conditioning system in the bedroom was difficult to manage tried to set it at  degrees but it seemed to jump back to  
 breakfast too expensive so ate elsewhere 
 too expensive for me most of the time 
 there was nothing not to like 
 receptionist stand offish and rude on arrival however i would visit again the positives by far outweigh the negatives 
 tea and coffee facilities were good but not excellent these places never leave enough milk in the rooms this is the worst thing i can say about the hotel and it s not even that bad 
 would be nice to have a pool and spa facilities and no views
 nothing we loved our stay 
 wish we could have stayed longer shame the room didn t have a view but didn t matter for one night 
 i would of loved to of stayed another night or two 
 we had late night drinks and noticed all others had complimentary nibbles we didn t get any and over  for  beers it would have been appreciated 
 there was no table and chairs on the balcony and only  plastic chair in the corner of balcony in a double room you d expect there to be 
 not sure bar a little expensive compared to other similar venues 
 only a one night stay 
 the room itself was clean and of a good size but lacked in any form of character it felt like a place for business rather than somewhere you would go for lesiure it was a stereotypical hotel room very basic design art on the walls you d expect to be in every other room no character or unique qualities the view from our room was also dissapointing a concrete wall it made the room very dark however not all rooms can have a view and that is understandable in this instance i was after something more romantic but for those who aren t this hotel is perfect and cannot be faulted for its cleaniliness and quality of staff 
 the maid coming into my room on both mornings at  when mentioned to desk on checking out it was meet with minimal empathy
 room was directly opposite an office that could see in our room 
 breakfast overcooked expensive and tried to add service charge removed when i complained not easy to get to by tube 
 pillows to soft and room service to keen woke us up by barging into our room twice in the morning 
 the water boiler for preparing the tea was in a cabinet when we moved on the table to prepare the tea outside the cabinet the fire alarm went on the personnel recommended us to always boil the water in the cabinet 
 nothing
 we paid extra to use the club lounge but they didn t provide spirits which was disappointing as you have to drink a lot of beer and wine to justify  it was the only bar part of the break 
 the executive lounge was a let down and i would not pay the extra to access this facility again 
 the only thing was that i had asked for a piece of chocolate cake with  candles a  and a  and was promised that it would be taken care off but when we arrived at the hotel i was told that there is no chocolate cake and that they dont have candles a bit dissapointed there cause i would have taken care of it if not promised otherwise 
 nothing
 they forgot to service room and had to be called late afternoon even then they failed to clear a drinks tray
 the club lounge was good for breakfast however not up to much for the remainder of the day no spirits canap s or snacks only beer and mixers and water
 i still found the hotel a little on the expensive side also not a big thing but if you re going to have a bose sound dock in the room there s no point in it only being compatible with outmoded ipods iphones 
 expensive breakfast price 
 bathroom too cold and not heated towel bar heated but only when room key is inserted also a little surprised by the club room no snacking possibilities no english beer 
 the price is steep it is quite luxurious but maybe not  a night luxurious 
 not a single thing 
 breakfast was quite expensive and wasn t included in the room price they also added   service charge which for a self serve buffet seemed excessive although good choice of food and tasty
 nothing everything was just right 
 nothing to report
 there wasn t any information prior to dining to inform us only the new year s eve dinner menu was available however our request was promptly dealt with and we were able to choose from the a la carte menu 
 nothing we didn t want to leave 
 children in the club lounge however hotel adjusted bill when commented on
 service is really poor in this hotel very expensive for low value services for same price you can find something better in the same location there is a bar in the main lobby the team is inefficient and not friendly at all 
 nothing maybe i would have loved to have a bath tub but the shower is good
 i know this is london and an extremely nice hotel but it is very expensive 
 the bed was uncomfortable the bath was not able to be emptied due to a faulty waste system and perhaps most disappointing was the club lounge which only served drinks with no snacks one of the fridges was broken and the coffee machine was temperamental a poor experience compared to the hilton or other equivalent lounges i wouldn t have minded that much but i purposely opted for the more expensive room with lounge access 
 rude reception staff at check in rooms were not ready and we had to wait in one room for  mins then when we enquirer where our other  rooms were going to be ready we were told not yet when we were eventually given our rooms they were not fully serviced and once used the key card would not work but apart from the check in the hotel was great
 we were unable to check in when we arrived and had to wait until half  by which time we were off to the ballet and did not arrive back at the hotel until  o clock however being the weekend before christmas i can understand the hotel was very busy and the staff were as helpful as they could possibly be 
 nothing 
 there was a big problem the staff apologized and i was to have received a refund of some money but i never did athe issue was stressful i would not return
 the standard room was small perhaps one of the more expensive ones would have been better you literally could just walk around the edge of the bed breakfast was very expensive we didn t bother just  minutes walk along the road was pret where the price was a quarter as much 
 nothing
 it s not really a bad experience but i did find a pair of socks from the previous guests in the corner of the bedroom there was also an awareness of noise when the outside door was opened and closed so i would request a different room next time 
 nothing would happily stay in any apex property and now considering a stay in edinburgh
 dinner in restaurant was okay but little too expensive also breakfast was quite expensive many caf s around can t recommend garfunkels near st pauls quite far from underground if carrying a suitcase but bus stop in front
 ok not major moans but far too hot in main areas halls but room has thermostat to cool it down restaurant wasn t good just about ok food a little cold and too pricey for what is was 
 breakfast was a little over priced but we did get a  discount 
 expensive but this caliber of hotel in this location are all very expensive and relatively speaking this venue provides good value 
 we paid  for the day for car parking but when we asked the concierge we were told that the hotel had discount parking  mins away why don t they advertise this a van parked outside outside our bedroom and left the engine running which was bad 
 we couldn t check in with two attempts even at  pm which meant because of our own other plans we did not get access to room until gone pm although we had a complimentary upgrade we could not make full use of the facilities and enjoy this lovely hotel fully 
 parking there isnt any the parking is about half a mile away the hotel could do with valet parking services 
 the walk from the nearest underground it s not really that far but i m pregnant so i struggled a little bit
 i just don t think a room without breakfast is worth  i suppose the problem is that if people will pay it you can charge it 
 bathroom smelled soooo bad like a dead rat un the pipes and at h in the morning cleaning lady entered the room while i was still asleep what the hell 
 breakfast is quite pricey but lovely
 breakfast in the morning is not very well organized could wait more than  min before getting your english breakfast
 we found the mattress a bit stiff have doubled the topper that helped minor points only one hook in bathroom we needed more lights in cupboard fine but why no lights in tea coffee cupboard we could hardly see what we were doing with the hot water 
 the only drawback no parking but there is a public car park  minutes walk from the hotel in the preliminary correspondence with the hotel we received very polite and detailed instructions on how to find parking special thanks to the staff for it 
 hotel clearly had issues at breakfast and couldn t cope at busy times with several guests waiting  mins for their cooked breakfast however hotel didn t charge and sent a quick email apologising
 as in most hotels it is hard to see adequately in the mirrors to put on make up or for my husband to shave a very common fault 
 only one european style  volt electricity plug however adapter would have been available 
 expensive glass wine but you pay for the location not a problem
 slightly further away from tube stations but good bus links and ttaxis
 very few cons entry from street was how we entered initially not best with luggage rear court entry hard to find was better some cabs knew some did not also lack of hooks in entry or bath made for sleek look at some loss of function 
 breakfast is very expensive    even if compared to hotels like the househorse guards where it costs some  for a richer variety of products a more comfortable restaurant and a more personnal service it s better to go to balthazar or even a starbucks where you feel you re paying for what you get 
 the bed wasn t the most comfortable and the room was fairly small for the price we paid 
 breakfast in bed was expensive and was almost cold by the time we ate they forgot the orange juice 
 a computer glitch caused double holds to be placed on my credit card for my stay however the staff responded quickly to attempt resolution of the issue 
 the pillows are super thick so if you prefer thin pack your own 
 the restaurant and bar are expensive not much to do in the immediate area at the weekend but the west end and thames are just a short walk away
 the grubsrew that secures the tap faucet to the tap mixer unit was missing and was only discovered to be missing when the tap was used and water pressure then pushed the faucet off the mixer tap base this was reported to reception on sat sun and monday morning still no fix before check out amusing the first time you flood the bathroom and take a cold shower more amusing when the second time it is not you who gets wet definitely not amusing when it happens a third time because maintenance cannot fix the faucet only push it back on 
 only minor thing was room wasn t ready  hours after we could have checked in we then waited another hour with a complimentary drink it didn t detract from our stay but if we had waited  hours it would have time from check in to room ready 
 the only issue we had was finding the hotel via our taxi drivers do a little research on the location beforehand to help your taxi driver out 
 menu breakfast not included and expensive visit to gafunkals cafe  min walk was a great alternative 
 nothing 
 the only tiny issue i have is that there is no green tea available in the room without having to call room service 
 no milk for tea making but it didn t really interfere with the great stay we had 
 nothing
 i wish we could have stayed longer 
 nothing

 ridiculous service charge at bar even though you go to bar and get your own drinks and take them to your own table reason being that waitress did not understand order for bottle of wine even pointing it out on menu 
 nothing 
 expensive restaurant lacked any character
 breakfast was decidedly mediocre given how excellent everything else was certainly wouldn t pay extra for this next time 
 the room on the first day was a mile away from the lifts however on the second day another room was found where we did not have to walk so far 
 breakfast could have been better organised with a few extra staff although the hotel appeared to be fully booked and therefore was very busy a few items were unavailable on sunday due to shortages the breakfast itself was great and the staff impeccable

 slightly expensive as paid  with no breakfast included 
 rented junior suite bedroom area had no windows
 the first night we were given an extremely small room with the bathroom door broken next morning when we made a complaint they gave us a perfect room 
 they stolen  from my money from the safe box at my room i couldn t report to police because shortage of time to reach my flight back they can watch the cameras and identify easily the staff who entered my room and return back my money 
 the room was appalling i had originally requested a room with a balcony as a special request and i understand that may not always be possible in saying that they gave me a room in the basement supposedly it was a bonus gift from them as it was a bigger room to what i had originally booked which made me think how small could my room have been if this so called bigger room was this small there was a window with three magnificent view of the buildings pipe work there was a constant noise out the window from a machine of some sort there was not much room to hang clothes or put things away there was a tiny built in wardrobe which could barely fit a handful of tops but the room was for  i will not be staying here again 
 the change of hotel story it repeated with every gusts so i have reviewed some of gust comments before and i faced the same if you booked a room for three adult which is queen bed and sofa beds you will stay in the basement which i will not recommend so the only room fit  adult is in the basement otherwise they move you up in room with extra bed for non adult the room pic dose not match the reality 
 our room seemed hidden away in the bowels of the hotel it did have a large frosted window but when examined it clearly looked out on to a manky neglected ourdoor light shaft 
 noisy air con 
 our first room had water leaking from the ceiling room above dripping down into our room we had to change rooms and the staff refused to give a monetary refund discount for the inconvenience i asked to speak with the manager about my disatisfaction and for  days was put off additionally the ac was very loud did not work well and i was always hot the junior suite was too small for  people the sheets were not changed for  days choose a different hotel 
 our rooms were in underground floor it s nothing specifically bad but was not mentioned during booking unstable wi fi signal in the room but still working the worst part is tiny bathroom it combines toilet and shower on a very small patch and if you are not alone after one person takes a shower everything around like floor toilet is absolutely wet 
 very small rooms bed was uncomfortable shower flooded the bathroom no bath carpet and mattress were stained expensive compared to other hotels we could have booked in the area that would have offered the same standard 
 the photos of the compact room do it show how small it really is this room will only just have enough room for you luggage 
 it s very close to another hotel with almost the same name so we went to the wrong one first not really their fault checking in was very chaotic it was very busy some people had been double booked also when we went to check in at  pm one of the rooms wasn t ready as they had a late check out which i didn t think was a very good excuse the hotel was ok but it was expensive for what you got it s the location you re paying for 
 run down needs new furniture and painting not clean enough and when cleaner comes with just polish and a rag then you know it s not being cleaned good enough 
 more tea bags and milk for making your own drinks would be good 
 rooms were not very well maintained not clean at all to be honest we were expecting better in the money we spent i will never stay in this hotel again 
 the a c control in the room did not work we notified the issue the day we checked in but it was never fixed we needed to call the counter for them to change the room temperature the furnishings in the lobby need attention they look old and beat 
 room was extremely small with very strange walk in wardrobe space i feel the layout of the room and the dark wood did not help not good if you are claustrophobic also as we were in an internal room we were unable to open the windows bathroom tiny but adequate with a fantastic shower anyone of a larger build would struggle to move around in there i would suggest a taxi from the station or underground if you have any luggage as its approx a   minute walk and there are a few junctions to negotiate 
 we couldn t see out of our window there wasn t much of a view 
 wifi is slow as it seems to be in most london hotels breakfast is buffet no a la carte available
 the room was very small and at the back of the hotel off the main corridor we checked in late in the evening and i felt we got the small room at the back cause we were late arriving 
 tiny rooms v small shower cramped space for suitcase
 more space just my wife and i packed in room on website rooms appeared much more spacious staff was nice but very difficult to communicate with 
 tricky to find as there are two similar named hotels in same area 
 the restaurant is quite cramped and seemed to be a bit chaotic at breakfast i waited a long time for my pot of tea then when i asked when it was coming i was given someone else s pot of tea whom had also been waiting for a long time 
 underfloor heating in bathroom was on even though there was a heat wave 
 the mattress was a little crunchy 
 rooms are a bit small with not much space to store clothes but the beds are big 
 this is a noisy overpriced hotel when i arrived they put me in a ground floor room next to the road really right next to it when i tried to go to sleep all i could hear were people outside and the television upstairs i requested a move and was given a new room some where in the room was a boiler unit in the wall that would turn on every now and then and sound like a small jet engine in the morning i could here the person above me taking a shower and flushing the toilet 
 although it wasn t an issue for me as it wasn t vital there was no instruction to operate the tv and the provided handy device 
 nothing a nice hotel in a very convenient area with excellent staff 
 very tiny space no room to walk at all shower is super small i am tiny myself but i didn t have room to turn around 
 the loo hadn t been cleaned and had been well used 
 the room was a bit small but still very good for london standards i was at first disappointed that there was no proper shower it was the floor of the toilet bathroom which you don t expect from such a hotel but in the end it was ok and the water had good pressure 
 the design of the toilet bath area will get the whole floor to be wet would be better if there is a segregation the tap of the basin seems to be old and it was very tight 
 room was advertised as twin bed but was only  bed not very appropriate as i was travelling with my mother yrs and had to share it no reception for my phone in the room
 n a
 we could not close the door to the main room door without having to lift our bed up and the bathroom was just a wet room that was so small it made the whole bathroom wet stright away
 the staff here are indifferent and the hotel didn t respond to communication in the lead up to my stay i arrived  hours prior to check in time and had emailed twice in the week leading up to staying to ask for an early check in even offering to pay for it after a  hour journey from australia i didn t receive a response and my room was not ready until  hours after their advertised check in time i was offered a toilet off reception to use to change and told they would store my bags the toilet floor was covered in urine it was a disgusting and disappointing start to my trip that coloured my view of the hotel 
 there was water dripping from the ceiling in the bathroom in the morning which i thought was odd there was also no plug near a mirror to do my hair 
 seat cover in dining room badly ripped which detracted from the ambience a little 
 very restricted in bathroom too small and did not like the overhead shower 
 first night i was put in a basement room with no signal not ideal when you re trying to work in the evening they moved me for the nd night and the tv didn t work for the majority of the evening 
 shower screen could have been a little wider so less water splash but we sorted it very quickly as it was 
 bathroom needed a bit of renovation
 the bed was very uncomfortable and too small the room was smaller than expected and it was a luxury room 
 nothing everything exceeded my expectations 
 i did not stay long enough to spot any flaws i thoroughly enjoyed the experience 
 i stayed for  days in the hotel first of all the room was very small and not like in the picture very small then the a c controller was not working in the room so each time i had to call the reception to change the temperature of the room and the door of my room was in the front of the lift and because it is very old lift there was noise from the lift they told me they will change the room but they didn t 
 room very small and air con didn t work but biggest problem was the position of the toilet as the wet room shower glass door was way too close to front of toilet so had to sit sideways and even then easy to hit your head when sitting standing
 our room was very small and in a basement that i did not expect the was no space to unpack things from suitcase not much daylight no view 
 room was tight bed was so close to wall you could not walk around it made getting into bed a challenge for one partner 
 for the hold on my credit card they took a physical impression on carbon paper can t prove this is related but that same evening i had a fraudulent charge on my card for   on itunes the hotel was great but i don t think i will allow anyone to take an impression of my card again 
 no fridge and only plug sockets were far away other than that the room was faultless 
 booked a club room when we arrived the room was under the main street and didn t even have any windows hardly  star and what you expect from a club room then we asked to be moved in the second room we didn t receive the complimentary dressing gowns  bottles of wine or fruit platter that you were suppose to get with a club room also when going to shower ready for the theatre at  there was no hot water which meant us having to have a freezing cold shower the club room bar they advertise is actually the only bar and the same as everyone else you just go through a different door to get to it with the label club lounge on it and we got charged for everything we had in there so don t see the point in having it or the difference in what you get for paying for a better room tottlag a waste of good money spent 
 the hotel is fine and well run but the rooms are small but that is the luck of the draw 
 paying at arrival cause when something goes wrong like there was no hot water next morning you cant just move somewhere else quickly 
 there was no hot water the day we checked out ended up travelling without a proper bath shave and while checking out not a word of apology either
 having to share a double bed instead of twin as advertised
 our room was far too small and with hindsight we should have asked to be moved one had to negotiate around the bed with hardly any wardrobe space and certainly nowhere one would want to sit comfortably 
 i didn t like the restaurant which was effectively the bar there was a single member of staff who had to do everything run the bar take food orders clear tables and take payments the food was just ok it wasn t a great experience 
 shabby room facilities poor wifi poor tv options terrible interface and charging for movies poor shower no screen no hands free attachment to wall bits falling off not very nice shampoo shower gel long hallways with sloping floors not very clever use of space awkward placement of wardrobe and desk may have been fine  years ago but not when compared to modern hotels who offer much more comfort for less or equal price 
 the rooms were well appointed however somewhat small for two friends perhaps with a partner they would have been alright we stayed in a club room 
 you can smell food being cooked in the morning although we were at the first floor rooms are not quiet too noisy you can hear your neighbors they do not provide complimentary water 
 the room was too hot and noisy we could not get the temperature down the carpets in the corridors were old giving a bad first impression the shower very small not normal for this price the bar was more like a waiting room 
 not electricity in room after card was put into place fortunately arrived late and left early but struggled the next day to get to work with low battery life 
 they dont have separate bed base for twin room but mattress are separate shower is small and i can hear upper room shower
 nothing
 don t be deceived by the pictures of the bedrooms booked a double delux room but when we got to the room it now seems we actually had a compact double room though reception confirmed we had a delux after we complained about the room size however now re looking at photos of a compact double room that is what we had very small double single bed with no real cupboard space enough for  shirts on either side of the bed some drawer space no room to put anything even your suitcase bathroom was a wet room did not pay for expensive breakfast and instead had breakfast on the way out in a cheaper cafe which are close by 
 i could not easily control the temperature in the room instructions on the wall would help 
 the shower had limescale on the floor the bed was dirty initially and room furniture was a little tattered but was all rectified when i was moved rooms twice
 reading lights over the bed should be individual impossible for one person to read without lighting up the whole room safe difficult to set and in strange position hairdryer difficult to use because of position inside a wardrobe 
 avoid basement rooms no windows we had for one night and staff offered us room change to upper floors for remaining three days when we requested 
 accommodation did not match website images not value for money unwillingness to allow us to relocate
 i asked the reception to book a taxi for me to the airport but at the time that the car supposed to arrive there was no booking at all so i need to call the taxi company by myself and fortunately there is a taxi available that day
 bed was a bit small and air conditioning had a noise problem at some point was fixed quickly but recurred a few times
 cleanliness awful there were two pair of dirty underwear behind a desk chair obviously housekeeping dies the bare minimum i was revolted bed no mattress pad gross itchy sheets because of my discovery of the underwear when i moved the chair to the desk i was obviously creepiest out fir the rest if my stay staff unfriendly and unhelpful 
 havent figured out yet 
 nothing
 we booked a trip with  rooms and in one room children of  and  however when we arrived they were given a double bed when i asked for a twin room as the boys didnt want to share a bed we had to pay a considerable amount extra for the twin room which we should have been told upon booking 
 restaurant could be bigger
 this hotel needs maintenance or may be even renovation bad hygiene i have never seen a four star hotel with a dirty lift elevator before rubbish litter thrown in the left no body would bother to clean it dirty bed sheets cannot be justified no matter how nice the staff were 
 room wasn t bigger than what i have expected wasn t that bad tho 
 small stuffy room and uncomfortable bed the room kettle was out of order footpath was being resurfaced outside our window ground level room rate was quite expensive 
 room had been made smaller what it should havebin not enough room for clothes no bedside cabinets not much room to pass at the bottom of bed not very good for  star
 the bathroom i didn t so much mind its smallness since i was travelling alone but what i resented was the fact that as soon as you ran water for a shower the bathroom turned into a swimming pool 
 the ventilation system worked throughout the night and was very loud even after turning the controller off didn t get much sleep as a result 
 on arrival at paddington hotel we were told that there was no hot water and that we were being transferred to another sister hotel the hotel was the same and was a nice hotel however as we had chosen the hotel due to its close location for all our planned activities being transferred to earls court south kensington was very inconvienient and distrupted our plans to the point that we were unable to make several visits that we had planned as we were unable to walk to the locations we had booked and had to spend extra monies and time using the tube taxis we received a voice mail from the hotel in the morning advising us of this fact but as we had already left for london we did not receive it 
 the room was way to hot l went to reception and told them thankfully it wasn t a problem they were able to change some settings at reception to cool air in our room and when we return that evening the room was nice and cool 
 breakfast should be included with hotel price it s a good spread but too expensive for extra fee 
 there was insufficient hanging space for clothes there could have been larger cups for tea and coffee making facilities or even a teapot the room was fairly small but perfectly adequate for a couple exploring london 
 this hotel was not a hotel i choose before then they transferred a new hotel where it s name is park garden kessington they did not say me this situation before it is very interesting experienced for us we are shocked nobody wants to go a hotel that they did not choose in booking they had to notify me about the changing hotel but they did not do it 
 lack of advertising there are two of these hotels on the same street having arrived at the wrong one first and waiting at reception to be told that their sister hotel was another couple of minutes walk up the road ok no big deal it was a nice day 
 couldn t really work the mobile device and had to go down to find internet code 
 like most london hotels the room is tiny smaller than the photos suggest 
 view was terrible i booked a triple room but with the sofa bed up u couldn t get round the room bathroom tiny 
 room was awful constant buzzing air con room was dark and cramped booked a luxury deluxe but the room felt like a standard no iron in the room overall bad experience 
 bed was very hard and bathroom would get pretty flooded from the shower but it was small so that might not be preventable 
 ganska slitet n got bristf llig st dning irriterande att det bara fanns tv l gen p belysningen i rummet och att b da s nglamporna styrdes med samma lysknapp 
 that i had to change hotel first because hot water did not work at this property so i payed for  nigts in a suite but the first night at the other hotel i just got a normal room 
 i couldn t point out anything
 not even a conversation with the hotel staff when checking in the room was a deluxe double room didn t seem like it seemed very small considering that this was our honeymoon you would like those extras thrown in like swan towels petals on the bed etc not even a congratulations either 
 very poky room shower room was soaked after a shower and you had to fight with the shower curtain at the same time as having a shower our room entertainment on the tv didn t work couldn t buy movies staff didn t seem bother about our issues
 rummet var mkt mindre n v ntat mobilt element men endast ett str muttag frukost var inte v rd pengarna r rigt frukostrum och h gljudd personal och det slutade med att vi t frukost ute varje dag l tt att h ra andra rum via ventilen i badrummet och matlukt fr restaurang 
 during our stay on both mornings we were woken at half  each mornig by a high peck noise coming from the pipes in the bathroom when we complained we were told it never happened by for we were given a  refund which was pound for the price of the hotel it should of been more by sleep on both nights was ruined 
 room given was in basement with view of a wall and nothing else felt a bit cheated by that 
 the only downside was the size of wardrobe not very deep and no chest of draws only bedside draws we stayed  nights so wasn t too much of a problem but if you had more luggage not much storage
 the mirror arrangements in the room were awkward to use for my wife the room one of the hidden wardrobes could have had shelves in it for extra storage the lack of double glazing meant we had to use the supplementary heater each evening only one comfy chair made tv watching awkward and difficult we did not take breakfast as we considered the room rate should have been inclusive of b fast 
 the room  is small and i do not like having to shower in the toilet area would much prefer a separate shower cubical this would stop me using this facility if i was given this room again as second time and not happy with the en suite facility air con was adequate other guest complained of it on the day as well 
 the beds weren t very comfortable the room was stuffy but we were able to open the window 
 this is the forth time i have used this group of hotels and the nd time i have turned up and had the excuse of there is a problem with the boilers and you have been affected and we will have to relocate you i told them to stop using the same excuse when they overbook the hotel as it does not work for me they tried to convince me to go to south kensington hotel which is told rubbish i managed to get another room in the hotel just very poor attitude to use on customers 
 the room was quite small and bathroom a little bit basic also found that the a c made some strange noises and had to ask for a remote control for the tv as none in our room 
 my father staying in a single room with a twin bed paid almost as much as we did for  people in a large king room with sofa bed 
 the bathroom was badly designed you couldn t go in after someone had taken a shower as there was no shower basin just a trendy drain away style hole in the middle the tap didn t work properly either
 do not book at this property absolutely no value for money rooms were extremely small very dirty with lots of dust everywhere bathroom was disgusting cracked walls mirrors and floors and toilet with no proper flush room sizes were extremely small for  people less than sqm which is beyond human we felt like rats living there with no hygiene standard absolute catastrophe for a  star standard equals more like a youth hostel in a remote area 
 the room was small 
 you advertised breakfast included in your booking com web posting when i completed the booking it did not indicate breakfast included misleading i emailed you at booking com and received auto reply with no direct follow up to my inquiry i asked hotel staff at check in and was not offered the breakfast your booking service is less than satisfactory in this regard the hotel is not  metres from paddington closer to  metres 
 they take a temporary deposit from ur credit card to make sure you don t cancel and even after paying cash on checking the keep ur money from your card for a further  days after staying which is uncalled for also wanted  despite on checking for cover off mini bar of which i refused to pay to find out on arrival off our room the mini bar was empty so why need a deposit 
 i was charged  more than i should ve been and was never reimbursed the manager was very rude and not very helpful at all 
 my room was a compact double and it was really small made worse by a huge tv fixed to the wall which i had to squeeze past to get around the bed 
 bedrooms
 the room was lovely and modern but some furniture was looking abit tired and i booked a room that said book now pay at property but i was charged on my credit card which wasn t released for  days after checking out 
 the floor in our room was very slippery and we thought we should have had a better room considering they had messed up our booking and we had originally had a room that had no hot water etc 
 girls on reception weren t very friendly to request a late check out i had to call one hour before check out time  noon which was defeating the purpose of having an extra lye in as our flight wasn t until pm even though the hotel wasn t fully booked was able to check via this website i couldn t book a late check out upon arrival 
 incorrect room type allocated rectified for the second night of our stay but no financial compensation problem with electricity in the room on our second morning took almost an hour to repair a smell of greasy food at the main entrance and reception not very welcoming 
 i felt like they tried to trick me when i paid with visa card by offering the choice that i can pay in eur which as far as i understand incurrs additional costs why that 
 the room is so small the compact double room but no space for opening a suitcase everything shall be done on the bed too expensive even considering the location 
 very simple standard accommodation nothing to shout about no bath only a small shower in the small bathroom the toilet roll was positioned almost on the floor really which got wet when you took a shower 
  small window in room barely any light no view or fresh air felt like a cellar very small bathroom expensive 
 doorman and guests standing at the entrance smoking made it hard to get in and out also once the sofa bed was up fro the three of us it made the room very very small 
 the carpeting in the corridor out side the room was worn out the hotel needs to pay attention to detail the bathroom was not replenished with shower gel and other items had to ask for it everyday 
 receptionists that can smile or even respect you as a customer on check in it was great however on departure not even a smile and why does every hotel in paddington area require a photo identity having travelled around the world with the exception of middle east country s only paddington seem to have a hotel a trust issue all very frustrating and unnecessary 
 room was oppresive already not much light coming in and with dark wood alla round in room you din t want to spend more time than necessary in there i got a disabled room but a men of  cm in front of a sink at  m height isn t comfy staff wasn t present at all beside doorman no one greets even if they stand behind reception doing nothing and watching you pass by 
 noisy for some reason in the middle of the night you d hear the boiler sound which was extremely annoying since woke me up multiple nights one of the trainee staff came inside the room despite being told not to when they were searching for someone s bags it s nice that they help search not when you are showering on the toilet 
 would have liked fried eggs for breakfast as well if possible 
 we were given a very small room not in line with we booked but we were relocated to a bigger one everytime we hada shower during the  days stayed the bathroom was a flooded
 no fridge in the room very noisy heating system and very early and noisy housekeeping very poor and expensive breakfast cheaper to eat somewhere else 
 really small room hit my head on the roof i m not   i m   my wife had nowhere to hang her dress not good for our anniversary bit disappointed think the room would be better use for the cleaner as storage
 the food was not as good as i would have wished we ordered room service the steak was overdone and the condiments bowl was full of hp sauce no vinegar mayonnaise etc 
 n a
 our first night put in a rabbit hutch of a room unable to close door properly because bed was in the way the bathroom door also touched the bed the bathroom was just a small wet room no extractor fan took shower room full of water mirrors frosted over impossible to clear hotel obviously taking advantage of customers using this room outrageous to claim it s a double room  
 although the wifi is working very well there is little to no signal in the rooms of the basement floor  also the heating airconditioning system is a bit noisy 
 i felt on reflection that it was pricey for just a room
 very little space in the room bathroom was tiny was unable to enter bathroom after having a shower due to wet room style shower which caused the floor to be very wet for a number of hours after air conditioning unit made screeching noises when turned off or low fan and humming noise was constant when turned on also if temperature was set at less than c the unit was extremely noisy had to walk sideways to get from one side of room to the opposite side due to the position of the bed being so close to the end wall of the room 
 we didnt have a clue about london before we went so i think we might chose a more central location next time 
 very noisy in early morning cleaning stuff rude and unpleastant barged in lift and then would not move to let us pass very rude couldnt speak english
 we felt like the room let us down this made us want to eat out and just use the hotel for sleeping 
 cleaning could be a lot better
 fire door immediately outisde my rooms banged frequently during the early hours evening meal was served in the bar the restauarant downstairs was only for breakfast 
 nothing i can think of everything was super 
 older style hotel room with dated furnishings not very spacious for those travelling with larger bags 
 hard to find a single plug socket easy in room wood effect on walls made the room feel small and enclosed heating didn t seem to work well was  but didn t feel even  maybe because room on ground floor and draft coming through the windows didn t see the point of little entrance before getting in room especially there being no plug socket in there very disappointing
 didn t end up with the original hotel we booked and we were meant to have deluxe rooms which we didn t have
 temp of room a little cool and also needed thicker duvet for our preference but minor complaint 
 we enjoyed our stay
 there was a leek in the roof above the shower in room  
 the room was very gloomy despite being club room room service was very bad poor ventilation and location
 beds are old and not comfortable at all also the blankets need to be thicker or another blanket added especially during winter time 
 remember to get a room that s not in the basement level b 
 i think a bed topper on the mattress would have let me sleep better i like hard beds but this one was a little too hard 
 nothing
 it was bought as a present for my sister but even though i was promised the night before she could check in she was not allowed ended up using nearly all her spends to pay for the room her review follows the room service was wrong on the first night someone walked into our room and the fire alarm went off in the evening i slept eventually with the door barricaded with a small wooded contraption i cried once in the morning and once at night they are unbending in their rules and gave me a bottle of wine to apologise they admitted the information was wrong but the guy who spoke to me was in training i could not go out in the evening as could not afford it i had to stay in the hotel for the friday and was able to spend what little money i had on the saturday oh and at breakfast i hope you don t get stuck in the little cupboard they have the deluxe double room had no charger next to the bed and the wardrobe is really for one person for one night when i had a shower i had to remember to move the toilet roll as it got soaked the night before our anniversary was ruined apart from what we salvaged and this was all down to the hotel very upset with their unbending policies they need to think about their customers 
 the walls are so thin you ll wake up every time someone passes the corridor your bed will liteally shake when someone walks in m perimeter i couldn t get a good sleep on any night 
 room was baking hot but phoned reception and they turned off the heating 
 the size of the bathroom was abit cramped 
 the elevator was too slow we had to order empty cutlery cups and glasses every day the room survive should have this changed for us everyday 
 i asked them by email for an earlier check in and they never answered back we arrived at the hotel about an hour before the regular check in time and they let as wait till the exact time the room was a little bit cold and the air condition was not working correctly the tables for the breakfast was very small 
 our room design could be better needs small lights by the bed instead the only choice is to switch on very bright lights which are set in a very high ceiling above the bed blinding 
 was a bit strange going to the basement for a room 
 i booked a deluxe double and was told that the room had a queen size bed however the bed was pretty small the duvet was quite thin so i had to call down reception at am for a blanket also the room was very small quite claustrophobic the next morning after checking out we went to the bar to have a coffee we are the only ones there the barman took our order then disappeared for  minutes and didn t make our coffees so we left not good service at all 
 sofa bed and the fact that you could not shut the door with the sofa bed up you had to lift it up to shut the door
 the breakfast room in the basement was a little chaotic with customers and staff everywhere the food was good but not a good dining experience not what i was expecting compared with the rest of the hotel 
 i booked a deluxe double room there was nothing deluxe about it the room was tiny literally the smallest box room i have ever stayed in the bathroom towels were dirty and we had to request new ones be provided the shower curtain did nothing to prevent the water covering the entire bathroom floor which meant there was nowhere to then stand at the sink without getting wet there were no plugs near mirrors which made getting ready difficult i resorted to using the tv to see my reflection as i blow dryed my hair the room quickly got condensation due to it being so small however no windows could be opened altogether an awful experience and i will not be staying there again the pictures were completely disieving and the cost was ridiculous based on what we actually got very very disappointing 
 hangar space limited 
 a little farther from paddington station than l expected hour room service would be nice 
 the room was a bit small but you d get over it as you d spend little time in the room with all the stiff you be doing around london
 the room could have been a lot warmer there was no visible heating in it but there were  electric radiators but because there were  of us we had nowhere to put them 
 the room was noisy at night either because if the water pipes or air conditioning people would also stand in the corridor and have loud conversations outside of my room not the fault of hotel just rude people i had the compact double room and it really is compact wouldn t recommend for  people i m not a tall person and my feet were hanging off the bed shower was very small but convenient if you want to use the sink sit on toilet and shower all at the same time i didn t but it s possible 
 i was expecting to get a better room as we booked deluxe double but the room was located on the ground floor did not have a bath only shower so i do not think it was a deluxe room as we originally booked 
 my room was right next to reception and really noisy all night with people coming and going and shouting room was also tiny and we didn t even have the smallest 
 room a bit dated and needed some tlc iron leaked everywhere 
 after paying to secure the reservation i was asked to pay for the room upon arrival the money has been taken out of my bank account twice was advised that it was a pre booking that the money should be refunded into my account in  days not happy my account has gone overdrawn if the money hasn t been refunded by tomorrow then i will contact customer service and get them involved 
 nothing this hotel and staff are superb definitely stay here again 
 the only thing we didn t like was the wet room style shower in the bathroom however it was bearable 
 we were disappointed to find our room was not ready when we arrived at pm it was then ready after   mins so not too bad but as we were booked for dinner and a show in the west end it was stressful for us all at the time 
 there were a lot of stairs 
 room was a little small but that would be expected from being located in a central area 
 we were switched hotels at the last minute and no one notified us rooms were too small it s very likely they are the same size at all these same chains we had  adults and a baby with a baby bed even without the baby bed there was hardly any room to walk through the room but we made it work however it was a nice place to stay in a decent location lancaster gate station underground was closed when we were there or that would have been nice also 
 the room was a little cramped for  people considering the price that was payed for it 
 the room was cold on arrival the heating was turned off and it took a long time to warm up also it only single glazed 
 the check in girl was not very helpful basically she said i couldn t stay there because i didn t have photo id i informed her i had stayed there before but she didn t care ended up letting me stay the room didn t have no towels in it i had to call room service to get them the bathroom smelt very bad like old potatoes i will not be staying again 
 the room was tiny even by standards for having stayed elsewhere in the u k the room on the th floor got too hot and the ac unit did not work neither did the hair dryer so we kept the window open 
 the room is way too small no matter how well appointed it is nothing the hotel does can make up for the fact that this feels like a rip off every single moment barely any elbow room 
 the pipework in this building is very noisy and we could hear it people all night using the taps we also were originally placed in a room in the basement without windows which was not mentioned as a possibility in the room information 
 the shower was interesting as it was in the corner of bathroom with only the curtain separating it needless to say the entire floor and a couple of walls and maybe the roll of tp were soaked following use 
 the bathroom could have a bathtub 
 we went to the wrong parkgrand paddington moments before and they were very rude staff before they told us that we were not staying in this hotel 
 the room was incredibly hot however as soon as i rang reception they lowered the temperature immediately so we could sleep i just wish i had rung them sooner and given them an opportunity to help out earlier i could fault their service 
 the room was to small and there was not enough room or hanging space no place to hang your coat or sit 
 one member of staff was particularly grumpy but all others were perfectly happy 
 there was constant cold draft coming from the window which made the room cold at night even though the windows were closed it did not make any difference i hope the hotel can look into this matter 
 no closet in the room leakage from shower doors 
 i didn t book another night should have 
 not being able to sleep very loud noice in room sounded like a generator disappointed on the very little sleep i had 
 minor issues no lamps next to bed only spotlights that are too bright no plugs next to bed for phone charger no ironing board and iron in room major issues heating system didn t work properly impossible to control and was just too loud to have on while trying to sleep ended up just turning it off which meant we were freezing all night loud buzzing noise all night from either heating system or extractor from within wall cavity made it near impossible to go to sleep rudely woken at  am by idiotoic delivery men dropping off laundry our room was ground floor next to the rear entrance talking loudly non stop banging doors with engine on right outside our window for atleast an hour totally unnacceptable if that wasn t bad enough at am we were again rudely woken by some prat outside our windows removing hundreds of bags of rubbish from the basement below our room onto the road ready for collection absolutely no acknowledgment that paying guests were asleep less than a metre away from him and with the windows single glazing these loud people may aswel have been in our bloody room this room should not be in use with the current routines they have in place the whole experience was just a shambles after telling reception during check out we were brushed off with i will tell the relevant departments no mention of sorry or i ll arrange for a manager to call you 
 the shower wasn t designed particularly well as everything around you either got very wet or you got stuck to the shower curtain 
 the only thing i d say that could have been slightly better was the friendliness of the hotel staff they were ok but maybe need a bit more chat to there customers also as i am a genius booking com member i had free late check out but i wasn t able to find out whether i could have this or not until the morning we were leaving which left us a bit uncertain with our day plans 
 our double bed was two twins pushed together and i kept falling into the gap bathroom was a wet room door kept catching on the shower rail door was damaged due to the damp nowhere to put toiletries or toothbrushes loo roll almost on the floor so got damp room was dark small had no mirror furniture was a bit worn looking i prepaid for our room  months ago on an old bank card when we arrived at the hotel they wanted a copy of the card i paid on i no longer had this the staff member insisted that i paid again on a bank card that i had on me and that she would refund the original amount paid onto the old card i was very annoyed about this as there was no mention of having to bring the card i paid on after paying again on my only debit card it left me  short for my husband s birthday weekend refund will take  working days i had prepaid so far in advance so that i could forget about it and splash out a bit whilst in london my husband and i very rarely get a weekend without our children or the money to enjoy ourselves so this dampened the weekend for us 
 no satelite tv no parking at the hotel closest parking was   minute walk away in a pay display carpark
 i made the booking on behalf of my  year old son i am concerned that having booked in advance and paid in full for the room on my visa debit card at check in my son was asked to re pay on his card and that i was to be refunded this practice is unacceptable as it is only by chance that my son has a card and also as a student there was enough money in his account to pay for the room having to make this unexpected payment caused limitations and cash flow issues for my son i had purposefully booked and paid in advance to avoid any complications in my mind there was to be nothing for my son to do except check in and enjoy his room prior to handing to heathrow airport the following morning please advise why this occurred and why this process is employed the reimbursement of my original payment is exceedingly slow it should be instant as monies being held for a period of time from both my son and myself is inadmissible helen jackson
 rooms are a bit small without enough room to hang clothes in wardrobe also not enough wall sockets we had to move furniture and look behind wall fascias 
 tiny bathroom with no counter space 
 nobody had told us that our original hotel was undergoing maintenance but it was all sorted very quickly
 size of room small wardrobe space tiny for  people
 the size of the bathroom is very tiny especially in the standard room 
 the staffs attitude the cleanliness found nail clippings on the floor by the bed and also a dirty extension lead that was left in there by a guest before health and safety plug socket loose on the wall 
 didn t look like the photos online there were biscuit wrappers and rubbish on the floor by the bed 
 the room wasn t very warm even with the heater on the small vent in the roof wasn t enough for the room 
 standard room was no bigger than a closet stuffy and bathroom was a wet room very tiny room suitable for one person for one night staff very friendly and quick to respond when tv didn t work expensive for what we got
 tried to overcharge me for breakfast i d already paid for luckily i still had my confirmation email to prove it hairdryer difficult to get to as positioned in cupboard over bedside table 
 however when we went up to our room the rd bed had not been made up so we had to wait for all the bed linen towels etc to be brought up restaurant was absolutely boiling is there anyway that it could be better ventilated 
 our room was on the basement floor and there was a noise coming through the air vent the entire night which made it very difficult to sleep 
 had no dislikes found the hotel to be just what we needed 
 the receptionists were not polite their english wasn t even that good to begin with the room was very tiny you could barely pass by the bed if i was a bit fatter i wouldn t be able to pass the bed sheets were not changed since day one there were stains the toilet was so tiny and the shower was horrible there is no way to shower without drowning the entire toilet the location wasn t that great and it took us a while to get in and out of the area 
 if anything the curtain rail was slightly off centre my partner only noticed as she spent a long time lying on her back
 the bed on our room wasn t very comfy the sofa was a lot softer and we would have shared that instead of the bed if it was bigger 
 i informed the reception when i checked out that one of the bathroom tiles were loose and raised i also explained that i had stubbed my toe on the tile i stressed that i was not complaining merely pointing out a fault that i thought needed attending to i was disappointed that the receptionist showed little to no interest
 i booked  nights in this hotel i have paid the total fee when i arrived at the hotel but they also take  poubds pending transaction from my bank account i will leave uk in several days and cancel my uk bank account but they did not return my money i sent them emails but they didn t have reply me i ll not recommend this hotel to my friends disappointed 
 room was tiny even though it was meant to be double deluxe room but staff changed us into another room quickly the heating system is really loud 
 n a
 the restaurant was not open in the evening meals had to be taken in the bar area also no childrens menu or offer of smaller portions 
 the room was compact and efficient but lacked warmth very corporate and clinical feel
 the ventilation pipe was passing through my room and at certain moments at night it was producing much noise not letting me sleep well the room was really small and the shower tight 
 the room was small especially the double bed which was incredibly small the breakfast wasn t included in the room rate and expensive the wardrobes are not wide enough to hang more than one jacket they resemble the fridge door in their size 
 the air conditioner made a bird noise constantly we had someone look at it it stopped for about  min and started again we previously stayed at this hotel for the past  years this year the room was tatty we asked for an early check in by   hour the room was not ready for  hour after we arrived i do not believe we will stay there again i don t believe it was good quality for the price 
 you could hear the traffic although the hotel is not located near a main road you can hear vehicles passing by 
 staff could pay better attention to detail eg i booked a wake up call and never received it when i let them know that they basically didn t care 
 rooms were uncomfortable not properly cleaned very little space for clothing no shower curtain in bathroom so the entire floor got wet 
 my only small issue was i thought room service could go on a little later as it s a chain hotel but not a huge deal
 very small bathroom in effect a wet room fine for me but could be a bit small for a less able or larger person 
 the rooms were extremely small wardrobe was not usable no where to hang up anything wet also can hear the shower running in other people s rooms below and above you
 you can easily hear people talking or walking at the corridor 
 the air conditioning unit was making a lot of strange sounds beyond those of a typical unit 
 room was a bit cold and only a plug in radiator to warm it up ventilation system made an annoying humming noise every so often 
 the evening dining facility was not so good with a bar menu meal had to be sent back although again the lady on duty was very apologetic ourselves and various guests could be heard making detrimental comments on items purchased 
 i had a bad experience with this hotel during check in the woman in front desk told me that they have problem in water heating system and they cannot accommodate me in this hotel due to this reason and they booked other hotel for me i felt uncomfortable by this offer since the second hotel was far away around  miles and the hotel was full of guests and no one of them was talking about heating system so i decided to to turn the table against them so i request from woman in front desk to show me the room for testing the water heating system by my self suddenly her supervisor came i forget to take her name and it became clear that they have overbooking in this hotel it clearly proven they try to handel this problem by laying to the guests during that an european guest came for check in and the process for check in goes smothly i start shotting to the hotel staff by saying this hotel treat guests beased on nationality what a shame so the decided to give my room which was non refundable but they give me a very bad room with bad location later they change the room i will never book again in this hotel 
 i booked for  nights instead of  i contacted them within  minutes of the booking but as it was a special deal they refused to amend the booking even though i contacted them straight way the built in panelling in the room was a bit dated and made it very narrow and difficult to get around the end of the bed 
 a shower curtain there was none which is the style but it sprayed water everywhere on the floor
 the hotel reserves the fee of your first night from your account but doesn t use that money when you pay for the room so you have an additional amount of money out of your account which isn t helpful when you want to use it for spending money you then have to wait for your bank to refund the money to use again so make sure your account has enough in it 
 relatively compact rooms and small bathrooms limited closet storage space for clothes
 there was nothing on this occasion that i didn t like if i was going to be picky i would of liked it to be closer to the main shops 
 i confused this with the park grand paddington which is a few doors down the street their premium rooms are nevertheless rather small and kidney shaped ok for a  night stop over but hard to settle in to for longer 
 room was far too small window was so cold and drafty that we were all awake most of the night i ve never complained about a hotel before but it was awful the only place the cot would fit was in the window and the baby was genuinely freezing cold we had another young child so couldn t move rooms in the middle of the night consequently we all had no sleep it really wasn t acceptable the room was too small really drafty and the curtains didn t actually meet so the youngest child was up at the crack of dawn too really marred our holiday hotel offered  back on the room but this really wasn t enough based on such a terrible night such a shame because this place could be really great 
 see above
  start hotel should do more than a poor service every thing is chargeable even water the size of the room is so small and the design is very strange can not understand it the matters and pillow is very poor quality and had strong headaches every day morning 
 views aren t fantastic and the plumbing pipes are a little noisy from other rooms 
 the one time i did stay here and wasn t moved the room was large but with artificial lighting all around the perimeter on the ground floor right behind reception so could get noisy and also no power sockets to recharge any items badly designed room someone from the hotel needs to spend a night in the room to see the issues 
 compact double is a very small room tight wardrobe space safe not big enough for laptop no mini bar and or complimentary drinking water certain furniture fixtures looked quite used and could do with replacement refurbishment all in all a pleasant hotel though 
 although there is in room ac it seemed to make no actual difference to the temperature of the room
 the television and beside control didn t seem to work although that could have been me 
 hot water working but worked out better for us in long run
 shower room leaked water into the bedroom as the floor drainage wasn t appropriate previous occupants had got the carpet wet which wouldn t be difficult you need to shower in minutes to prevent water seeping into the bedroom 
 room was either way too hot or way too cold and window didn t open properly so had to have air con on to cool down but then became too cold no happy medium
 no new bottles of water to drink every day also only get biscuits with coffee in room on first day the air conditioner units just outside of the window makes a lot of noise during the night 
 fire door near our room banged during the night slightly annoying and could wake you up 
 the amount of sugar and milk that is left for you to make coffee tea unfortunately left a necklace in the room before we left for another location was never located 
 we were on ground floor with great bay windows but it must of been bin collection day so a bit of an early wake up call 
 the bedroom appeared small with all the wood around it the breakfast room was tiny for a full crowd and as was the bar where people could not enjoy a drink without listening to the table next door 
 buffet breakfast was a bit expensive rooms were a bit tiny but manageable
 the evening dinning area needs to be improved 
 no privacy the staff can come in any time although you lock the room from inside i found that quite shocking never seen anything like this in my life the staff will knock but will not wait long enough they just barge in also the wardrobes are a mockery of the word the layout of things in the room is quite awkward i e location of the kettle power charging points the so called wardrobes everything is at user un friendly location in the room 
 originally placed in the basement which is totally depressing without a window however i did ask to be moved and they happily obliged 
 we booked a deluxe room however the room was very small and it was difficult to change clothes for our night out therefore didn t seem like a deluxe room 
 the bed was too firm and the pillows too hard also the lighting in the bedroom wasn t too good and there was nowhere to plug in chargers near to the bed 
 what s with the breakfast confusion can t british hoteliers just run a restaurant if they want to charge for breakfasts it was one price if booked the day before a higher price that morning oops you re not on the list blah blah blah north american hotels have no problems dealing with this put it on your room or pay on the spot no dual pricing so easy please break the uk mode and make it easy 
 first night we had to stay in an extremely small room they did move us to a much larger room for the rest of our stay 
 not much the bar closed earlier than i would have liked surrounding area didnt have a lot going on but close enough to paddington station
 our room was not serviced the bed was two single beds pushed together 
 the air conditioning was not working and i had to change the room in next day and i could not sleep well that night 
 the tea and coffee making facility was poorly positioned on bed side table in my opinion this could potentially be very dangerous due to limited space need to find an alternative area 
 suit space is very small bathroom without a tub or shower breakfas area is small closed and crowded i styed in suit with king bed size but i foud it tow mattresses not one with king size it s horrable while you are sleeping
 the heating didn t work certainly not worth paying this much staff were not very helpful or apologetic but rather claimed their screen in the reception said it was warm soy milk at breakfast was either old or diluted with water
 fire alarms kept on going off randomly bit disturbing lighting in the room wasn t that great but overall a good stay with minor drops 
 the staff was very in co operative and the rooms were awful to say the least i was finally shifted to a bigger room but when i requested for check out till  pm on friday the lady told me that till  it was okay and she will try for  then she says that she will do it only till  and not till  no reason was given for this at all 
 size of the bedrooms were small had to phone each time for a ironing board breakfast was mediocre no comfort in the bar each time upstairs flushed the toilet or had a shower you could hear the water flushing down the pipes in our bathroom 
 deluxe double room significantly smaller than advertised just a bed with a small ring of floor space around it closet and desk folded off the wall hotel also offers a compact double room that is not that different would only book deluxe double if you are a solo traveller bathroom so small that there was a tiny drain in the center of it without separate shower so the bathroom got completely soaked with every shower 
 it wasn t mentioned that the room was a basement room and it was very different from the photographs on booking com the room was extremely dusty and we ended up constantly sneezing whilst in the room after we changed rooms we found the hairdryer not working it took a long time to deal with this in the evening the showers were weak in both rooms one day the keycard for our room stopped working and we had to get it changed overall too many problems 
 the automated room was a bit hard to understand for non frequent travellers staff should try to explain system or ask if the guest is familiar was moved from one hotel to a sister hotel and offered free breakfast in recompense but no one told the sister hotel and no one told me how i could go about getting it 
 deluxe double was tiny my partner is ft and hanging off the bed we were next to an elevator so loud noises all night shower was dirty had mould all over it and no pressure tv was on a weird angle so you couldn t see it properly if u have big suit cases very crowded and pillows and bed were uncomfortable but saying that we spent hardly anytime in the room so location was great for us 
 very poor value for money very poor room despite it being what was classed as a deluxe bed against window so had to scramble down the bed to get out very disappointed and first time i ve had a poor hotel from booking com
 the breakfast bleak and poor for that price even the pictures of it were faded and didn t give you a good impression of what was offered should have been included in the price of the room if that is all they can serve 
 the room was very noisy we could hear a fan of some sort outside the bedroom which came on periodically and was very loud every time someone in a room next door above or close to us flushed the loo or had a shower we could hear the water running through the bathrooms open drain the room was very small only one arm chair so when we had room service in the evening one of us had to sit on the bed to eat there is only enough wardrobe space for about  things to hang in when i asked why i hadn t got any complementary water i was told it was because i booked through you i made a fuss and did get it in the end but i felt like a cheap skate even though it cost me over  for the two nights 
 room was tiny and dark i got moved around to a different property one block away because park grand had hot water issues then when i checked into the second location they moved me across the street to a hard location too much money for such a small room 
 the main mattress for the bed is too soft feel painful for the back after sleep overnight the mattress for the sofa bed is too weak i still can feel the springs they can be good if you can choose the medium firm mattresses 
 due to it s location its decor the the lounge bar area was not very comfortable to sit relax in it was the walkpath to go to all the rooms 
 room was too small for  people a double bed with  mattresses does not pass as a twin overpaid for what i got 
 the double room was so small there was no room to store bags two people were unable to dress at the same time the walk in wet room was so small that when you turned on the shower it would completely soak the whole bathroom so no one else was able to use friends staying in a suit were meant to of received complimentary soft drinks fruit and dressing gowns which were not provided the gym smelt as if it was being used as a smoking room very disappointed in what appeared to be a lovely hotel with reasonable star rating 
 the shower water is hard i couldn t get the soapy feeling off even after washing for a while also on arrival at the airport i called the the telephone given to me at booking which took so long to answer i also found the direction address given to me unhelpful in fact a lady on the line directed me to apparently another branch of the hotel that the one i booked for was under renovation i turned up at the place i booked and found no renovation going on and busy and i got the room i booked for perhaps it was a mixup 
 the bathroom was not only small but the shower and toilet seem to be in the same position on showering there was water flooding the whole bathroom area the bathroom tiles were poorly put together with the grating sealant coming off quite easily it was just awful i will not book this hotel ever again in this paddington area of london 
 everything else you don t expect big and lavish rooms while staying in central london however a room which has just  inches of space around the bed washroom was also a disaster  plus per night is deserves more 
 one of us mobility impaired wish it were a little closer to underground station
 the bathroom wasn t really hotel standard no counters to do makeup or blow dry hair the room was too close to the stuff pantry noisy all through the night hotel stuff didn t bother to replenish towels or make beds properly carpet in the room was dirty from the day we checked in
 we arrived in the early hours to check in after paying a taxi to take us to front door we were asked to walk to their sister hotel down the street where they then tried to check us in again and charge us again then headed down to our room where the key card didn t work so headed back to reception they then came down with us and it still didn t work so told us to wait at the room they then returned and manually opened our door and said it couldn t be fixed until the next day it then soon dawned on us that we wouldn t be able to go for breakfast as we wouldn t be able to get back in our room the bed clearly hadn t been changed as there were other peoples hairs in the sheets and pillows my bedside table also had what i can only describe as orange zest all over it this was at   am so we decided to grin and bare as we were shattered then the morning came our wake up call of a fire alarm at   wasn t exactly pleasant followed by the cleaners ringing the door bell several times and getting us out of bed even though we had until   to check out we left and couldn t get out fast enough after a very bad experience we found ourselves on a street we hadn t planned to be on with no idea which way to head hopefully we wont stumble across this hotel again it really was a shame as it looked as if the place was actually run by someone who cares it could have been lovely but at the tune of   for less than  hours we wont ever be going back 
 the hotel operators are cheats liars and thieves i booked a double and even after calling them on the night of my check in to say that i was checking in late there was no room for me when i showed up at midnight there was also a family with a toddler asleep on the couch in their lobby who had experienced the same thing they moved me down the street into a single and then were totally unreasonable about offering me a discounted rate refund on the lousy room booo don t just walk run away from these crooks 
 room a bit small 
 the room had a terrible view of a scruffy building and the windows were disgusting lack of parking and staff said it would be ok to park where we did ended up with a parking fine ruined a birthday suprise i had planned for months for my partner wouldn t stay again 
 fairly newly renovated looks great but bathroom plumbing isn t the space is small and okay if you re travelling solo 
 we were not give the size of room we paid for first night we had to complained web mentions complimentary fresh fruit and water in rooms this did not happen wardrobe space nonexistence even for one person let alone a couple the rooms were too compact wash area needs care and attending to seals around basins and tiles
 delayed checking despite not arriving till pm  bed was child size and like a camp bed towels for  provided but not cups glasses toiletries they were all for  breakfast time was crowded in a small area meaning staff could not keep up with demand despite their best efforts no where near a  star more like  we don t understand how the aa rated as a  star definitely not worth the discounted cost
 small room at basement floor
 room very small but spotlessly clean 
 no refrigerator in the room you can ask the staff to put your food in the kitchen refrigerator very small room i think the bedsheets were not changed everyday
 some of the furniture was very dated and needs replacing i didn t like our club room being situated in the basement 
 the bathroom was quite small and no bath 
 would like to have had a bit longer for check out but this didn t really cause us too much of a problem 
 the chairs in the breakfast room had no padding towels need to be bigger as i m a average sized person and they didn t go around me 
 the room we have been given was not as i saw in the picture at and the bed was too small and the room was too small no places to hang my clothes
 the cleaning staff usually forget to replace toiletries that have been used up 
 we booked twin room but when we arrived they gave us double rooom anyway the other day they offered me the twin room 
 breakfast wasn t great our hotel had maintenance probs taken to hyde park grand hotel instead room was okay some parts a bit tired looking had discount online nights stay would have been a little disappointed if paid full price
 when we checked in at the given time of pm our room was unavailable and would be told we would have to wait in another smaller room for  hour  hours later our room was still unavailable due to having plans my husband  year old daughter and i had to get ready and prepared for our night out in a very small room we then had to leave our belongings with the staff who said they would put our things in our room when it was available fair enough our belongings were in our booked room when we returned to the hotel  hours later however we found this very unsettling there was no sofa double bed pull out in the room like there was shown in photos there was a tiny bed set up with a very thin mattress which my daughter said was uncomfortable 
 a single room allocated on first night for two persons was not acceptable the price of breakfast was too high as we did not have the cooked meal 
 not the hotel i booked room too small to swing a cat in inflexible cancellation policies
 bar area poor staff didn t know what they where doing a lot of waiting around at reception poor facilities in reception area 
 basement room cramped pics shown and actual room are different with a queen sized bed in the room you can forget being able to walk about no place to put bags 
 no plug in basin which wasn t attended to basement room very claustrophobic carpet was dirty 
 the beds and pillows were very hard and uncomfortable room had seen better days interior needs refreshing there was what seemed like animal hair on the bed linen so unsure if the room we were given actually allowed pets found toe nail clipping on the floor
 small bed rooms some in basement with no views like a dungeon could only hang  items of clothing up in cupboard very crushed dining room no room between tables 
 more than  yards from tube station and my partner struggled to walk bed up against window couldn t get cold water from tap 
 wet room bathroom meant whole floor would be wet after a shower personally prefer a separate shower otherwise great 
 one of the two matress was very soft maybe the variety of breakfast is a bit short for a stay longer than a week 
 eventually when i returned there was only one room left probably the worst in the hotel some staff were poorly trained gave misinformation 
 the small bed
 there was no iron or ironing board available within the room which is only a minor complaint 
 the air conditioning in the room did not work well 
 one bed was broken room  triple room breakfast was average everyday is the same breakfast the toilet location is very bad no space for the other leg
 wish we could have stayed a bit longer 
 the mattress could have been better didn t have a good night sleep 
 the club room was located in the basement with virtually no natural light the cafe restaurant was right next door to the room with grease odours permeating throughout the room the tiny room was decorated in dark stained chipboard and it looked as if it hadn t been decorated in years the room they moved us to the next day was better only as it was lighter don t believe the pictures on the website the staff were clearly not trained in basic customer service as they had little knowledge of solving even the basic of issues and found it difficult to hide their annoyance when i had the ordacity to complain 
 not unusual in london some rooms are small we upgraded to a bigger room for not much more money all the rooms look very newly refurbished and very well fitted out 
 the room was great for a solo traveller however space and wardrobe would have been a challenge for  of us especially if you needed to hang formal clothes the rainhead shower was awesome and the hand held option good if i had a full head of hair maybe a challenge if not wishing to wash it the unenclosed shower great if you do not need to use the toilet or brush your teeth after in socks as the floor gets wet again if  sharing would need back up of floor mats slippers etc 
 sofa bed uncomfortable very unhelpful concierge refused to allow customers to contact alternative staff who could make decisions
 after hauling  suitcases across london we were informed there was a boiler problem and we had to be moved after my initial reservations the sister hotel just around the corner exceeded our expectations the staff are truly amazing and went out of their way to ensure a great stay
 hotel was just a bit quiet for what we had wanted ideally it would have had more of an atmosphere around the bar or something in the evenings 
 bathroom sink backed up when very little water was run black mold on shower floor floor draining shower rooms a little cramped for space travelling with  people could have used more help with luggage on arrival 
 the meat in the breakfast was pork so we couldn t eat it during our whole stay since we are muslims 
 the facilities are not that much there is no refrigerator or iron i reserve a room with  single beds but there are no rooms with single beds in the hotel 
 on arrival we were given a basement room where there was no mobile phone reception and wifi also poor because it was underground and attitude of reception staff was v rood and not helpfull at all despite i was with family no adjoining rooms were not allocated even after the request reception staff flatly refused and they always refers to talk to booking com however we were given  rooms on second day due to pressure most dissapointing part was the attitude of staff male and female both were rood sujith
 small room bathroom spaces
 the underfloor heating in the bathroom was a bit hot but better than none there was only  bedside table 
 i think some bedrooms are quiet small but if only stay for one or two days is ok 
 felt the staff could be friendlier accent was hard to understand hotel is a little tatty and our deluxe double was tiny no wardrobe space except to hang  shirts nothing for dresses etc also was my birthday and my boyfriend proposed staff had been informed and nothing was supplied as a congratulations 
 the fact that i wanted to extend the stay which they were unable to do where as when i rang them before leaving i was told i could so then i had no choice but to pay extra i felt the staff was useless 
 the staff at the bar was not really qualified we ordered a bottle of prosecco but instead of pouring the first glass as one would expect the just left informing us  minutes later that we would need to pay as they are closing we got a room in the basement which is considering the price i would have liked to know prior to my stay 
 not sure it was the problem of the hotel or booking com the triple room i booked was canceled due to inefficient credit card i provided however the card is totally fine when i checked in to the hotel this cost a great trouble during our first night in the hotel 
 as mentioned staff have no authority to help the guest always they have to back the main office
 they gave us a room in the basement then when we wanted to change we had to wait more than one hour we were there at  pm don t know they did this because was a late arrival but it was a very bad beginning and not easy to get over because the second room provided had a window over a climatisation area and was very noisy  hour 
 the first girl on reception was a bit over the top the rest of the staff were lovely i was over charged for two extra nights i just emailed hoping to get a refund
 first room  was under the dining room and was extremely noisy scrapping of chairs on the floors woke up by the noise did complain and the staff who were very very helpful moved us to a room that was smaller but quieter so we had a very nice sleep
 the gym is in the basement floor at the end of a long corridor not so encouraging to use because of its location 
 bedroom was like a walk in wardrobe staff had very limited english wasn t asked if i slept well on either nights room had a loud running water noise all night premier inn hotels are xs better
 the room was at the back of the hotel and the window was looking at another guests window poor light ng was coming through it was like a dungeon 
 nothing 
 the room was very small for the price and the wet room toilet was very very small so if you had a shower it would get the whole floor wet the room was hot and we could only open the windows about  inches 
 the staff in room service over the phone were rude the bathroom was a wet room which flooded everytime you had a shower as the plug was blocked the room was very small just big enough for a double bed 
 bathroom was ridiculously small and tight shower sprayed all over the small floor making it slippery as did the tiny sink the rooms are faded and dated and didn t strike me as very clean would not book here again 
 maybe some better refreshments in the room instead of wine but other than that couldn t fault it 
 didn t appreciate the small room originally allocated given i was staying  nights had issues with the bathroom of the new room allocated as well but friendly staff sorted it out 
 i hated the fact that there was no lip on the shower the entire bathroom was wet after one of us had a shower never saw this in a hotel before the room was very small for a so called deluxe double the hair conditioner was never replaced 
 check in seemed unnecessarily fussy in terms of things that needed a signature i ve checked in to other hotels through bookings com before and hardly needed to sign anything on arrival also although i didn t go in to the club room it didn t look anything special through the windows and certainly nothing worth upgrading your room to have access to i didn t see the point of it 
 all good nothing to dislike 
 we were given a twin beds pushed together that kept separating whenever someone went near the middle and also were given a room in the basement had a frosted window so there was some natural light but not able to open it or have a view asked for both things to be fixed and the staff were unable to do anything except put a sheet over the two beds staff were generally unhelpful and snooty no information given at check in
 as a family of three we needed the fold out bed which was really uncomfortable the head lower than feet and a metal bar could felt across back 
 there was no plug beside the bed for charging my phone 
 i requested a tomato soup in the evening from the bar the service was very bad the place was empty but they took ages to bring the soup it was awaful soup the worse i ever tried just a red color with heavy layer of fat with no taste disgusting for dinner eat outside the hotel there are acceptable resturants around the area 
 couldn t see a hairdryer but didn t ask so it may have been available 
 a c in lobby was not operational during check in but not the fault of staff felt badly for them as we were soon ensconced in our a c room 
 a lot of chipped and broken furniture not much room in restaurant for a busy hotel television was confusing to operate loud air conditioning 
 at the location we booked they said there were issues with the room so we had to go to a different location something this hotel seems to do a lot looking at the other reviews the other location was just around the corn we but the room we were given was definitely not the size we booked 
 no curtains in room and staff very unhelpful when told about them told we should have complained the night before but we did not notice as it was late when we got to the room staff refused to deal with the complaint 
 nothing it was all very good
 n a
 bedrooms are way too small also double beds of three quarter beds booking show you photographs for their larger rooms for their standard double rooms
 called up hotel to ask if i could leave a bag two days prior to check in and was informed this was ok on coming to the hotel i was informed i could not do so i would not have minded if i was given the correct information when i first called secondly the receptionist on duty did not handle the situation well she was unsympathetic and said i may have misunderstood what was told to me by phone implying either i do not understand simple english or perhaps am too stupid to understand the halogen lights in the room are too bright and glaring 
 none
 noisy old floor
 the room was just a bit compact fine for a solo traveler but i wouldn t have wanted to be sharing although having said that the bed was very comfy 
 wardrobe space could have been bigger
 room was very small and the wardrobe is only about  inches deep within a wall panel the bedside table below it made it very difficult to reach if only there for a night this would be acceptable but there was  of us for  nights this was described as a deluxe room and was told be reception staff that you need to book a club room to get anything bigger 
 room and shower room very small shower room was pointless as water just went everywhere and had to use all the towels to dry so that i could continue using facilities lady serving drinks in bar was not qualified to serve as had no idea how to mix certain drinks 
 didn t like the first bedroom we were put in was in the basement dark and claustrophobic given a better room on nd floor breakfast room was bit small and very warm 
 firm pillows
 left my earrings behind called half an hour after check out the room hadn t been cleaned it was  minutes later but they couldn t find the earrings i saw them before leaving and believe they were taken
 very small room the shower room could have been a lot cleaner as it was a wet room but very small the water covered the floor so using the toilet after someone had showered was very very slippery 
 the breakfast was crowded the restaurant small and food wasn t piping hot we were advised of wifi but this wan t available in our room as was in the basement meaning we had no phone signal either not all bad 
 room was a little small and  nights was enough 
 rooms on the th floor are extremely small you have to wait in line to have breakfast the space where they serve breakfast is claustrophobic 
 the layout of the room was a bit awkward otherwise our stay was lovely and we were very pleased with the accommodation 
 only stay here if a loud fan in the room does not bother you even when i switched it off it was still really noisy the result minimal sleep not ideal when all you want is a peaceful nights sleep ahead of a busy day 
 what s not to like 
 hot breakfast didn t look very good very pale scrambled eggs not quite up to the standard of the rest of the hotel and breakfast very limited wardrobe space 
 the continental breakfast was a bit too expensive 
 i asked the desk person to order taxi for certain time but because tube down no taxis the person should have let me know right away unable to book taxi as had plenty of time instead i had to run with all my luggage and missed my bus cost me additional money to get next bus 
 breakfast too expensive 
 more coffee sachets and some juice soft drinks in the empty mini bar would have been good 
 got there at   to leave bags was told room would be ready for   when we came back to hotel at   was not ready and had to wait another  minutes
 the room we were in only had a view of rooms across the other side of the building 
 bigger dining area for breakfast breakfast queus where possible if you are not an early bird this may be partially solved by recommending breakfast in bed for guests 
 beds are terrible lumps and tilting building is run down
 i was moved to this hotel on checking into my original hotel receptionist informed me that because of the change i was going to get breakfast inc when i went to the room i had been allocated it was very small in comparison to my original room i had booked i was disappointed and told staff who informed me that it was the only room available but i could check with her again in the morning breakfast was ok but a very small area to move around in think i was probably overcharged as well 
 my bag was stolen from the hotel lobby and that speaks a lot on poor management and lack of security it took the hotel half an hour to view the cctv footage and i think the response from the management was atrocious i lost a lot of money and as a traveler it was a nightmare to be in an alien city without any help from the management the management did not even apologies for what has happened i would advise booking com to withdraw the hotel from their system and also advise travellers to not to stay at this hotel imagine a bag being stolen from the lobby of the hotel very poor attitude and shockingly unbelievable behaviour 
 the staff is unorganised i ve booked the hotel through booking com and i ve paid for the room in advanced the staff kept on letting me put in my card again and again thinking that i haven t pay yet which made me late for the meeting also i ve arrived an hour later than the time they set for the check in and my room is still not ready 
  i booked a deluxe room a couple with  months infant and noted my late check in by calling the hotel upon arrival no one helped us with the babystroller and our  bags receptionist was looking and waiting  we have been given a room that is just a door and you directly must hop on the bed i doubt if it is suitable for human being though we have an infant and i ve been told ooh ok that was our last room sleep and squeeze your baby and tomorrow we give you another one  in that room no refrigerator to keep my baby s milk and food i guess that is illegal and no one cares  there is no shampoos no soap nothing at all a blocked sink  next day another room and offered me a breakfast to please us after i spent the night sleeping under the bed to give a space to my child  i just had a look at the breakfast sorry this is not something to offer i moved away immediatly  the hotel is outdated and rubbish  they took extra booking price compred to the one i see on booking with a difference of  usd
 the room was slightly cramped there was an unnecessary mix up with the registration which resulted in our getting a smaller room but had free breakfast thrown in instead 
 the hotel good location and clean but some staff very badly with me really i surprised from them they should be more professional and helper all coustmers they need more study and qualify in field hotel business bcz the price increasing more that  that not accepted in any hotels and countries special in uk we like uk thanks
 bathroom was very tiny 
 the breakfast area seemed to be too small to accommodate all the guests every time we came there was a waiting time to be seated however well managed by the staff 
 maybe a little nicer view for  nights though no grumbles 
 view from room was of a wall looking at another part of the building 
 we ended up in a very small room up many flights of stairs even by london standards and no one ever came to fix the tv because we were relocated to the attic we did get free breakfasts 
 the room was very compact and the bathroom was a space saving wet room a bit of a squash for  people but manageable for a couple of nights 
 bathroom was small and with few shelves or places where to put personal stuff such as combs cream shaver etc room lights were poor no night lights for raeding hair dryer inside a wardrobe not accessible from the bathroom only to be used from the bed furniture in wood needed maintenance 
 room was dark and cramped not great value for money 
 the room is too small especially the toilet it does not have a proper shower area and everything is wet after one is taking a shower 
 the shower flooded the floor every time the basement room had no opening windows to a grotty storage yard the bar shut too early 
 slight back room noise in our room from outside the staff did try to deal with it but couldn t do anything about it but did offer alternatives
 we were transferred to grand park paddington court and was not able to see the rooms i booked the court s room toilet and bath is small not suited for  persons as expected
 room was on the ground floor named club room indeed good in size but with strange dispositioning of wardrobe hairdryer 
 nothing really other than room maybe slightly small for  people but manageable 
 despite  rooms being paid for in full in advance with a company credit card the hotel were still worried about something what i don t know so they insisted the person named on the credit card to be present even though they had already been paid ridiculous one of our travellers paid for breakfast then when she sat down for breakfast they told her she had not paid when she had we will not be using this hotel again 
 the room was overall filthy i doubt if the bed sheets were changed before my arrival and the toilet cleaned found human hair in both the corridor smelled burned cooking oil from the kitchen it was one of the most disgusting hotels i ve stayed at it certainly didn t worth the amount of money i paid for it 
 the breakfast buffet was ample but not high quality products i would suggest going elsewhere for a good english breakfast 
 we were there for  days it would be nice to have something different for breakfast not the exact same thing everyday there was only one elevator so sometimes it was a bit of a wait 
 i was moved on arrival despite only booking that day apparently there were maintenance issues but it didn t stop the group in front of me checking in the hotel i moved to was further away from where i needed to be small room was not the cleanest a bit tired and not somewhere i d have chosen to stay overpriced and dissatisfied 
 everything was fantastic only thing that could have been better is that my bed was too short 
 nothing 
 we booked a deluxe double room for  nights spent two nights in a compact double room no deluxe double rooms were available for us we also didnt get fresh towels on day two definitely not  stars 
 there were no real restaurant facilities only the breakfast room and then the bar 
 really helpful staff but staff were not allowed to kept the bar open after our visit to the shard so eight of us had to have a drink in one bedroom
 basement room so no natural light couldn g get room service on one of the nights listed as  star hotel i wouldn t rate it that high compared to others i have stayed in 
 room not available on time staff helped someone behind us before helping us hotel insisted on photocopying my identification which i refused breakfast disappointing
 the room was very difficult to access within the building which consists of townhouses that have been remodeled as a hotel we had to go up an elevator up some stairs down some others and it was confusing long and very difficult to handle with our heavy bags thankfully the staff is attentive and responsive and there to help with luggage another issue was that while the bed and room was clean the window was very dirty the window was also small due to the location of the room within the building 
 the people behind the desk really ought to be able to read the details of a booking properly to avoid guests being misdirected to a considerably smaller room this took too much time to correct 
 bed was hard as a rock worst nights sleep ever bedroom was squashed was tiny no need for the word deluxe far from it no breakfast included and already paid  pound to stay never staying again 
 rooms are slightly small and there is just a little noise from the corridor because the floor is wood 
 there is no shower cabinet but the shower is only separated via curtain the complete bathroom was wet after taking  minutes shower at check in they offered to give us a local smart phone and we signed some papers it was supposed to be at room but we never received the phone even after calling the reception from the room twice when we asked at reception they apologized for it and told us there was a problem but i found it quite weird 
 poor staff that couldn t help me having to pay for the room before i checked out having a damp basement room that shouldn t have been rented out water stains on the ceiling
 the booking was done for deluxe double room and from rd i called them ahead to tell them i will be checking only on th morning i land up to find the reservation was on hold even though they had charged me on the previous day itself once it got unblocked they provided me a compact room where if you walk you will hit a wall when i enquired about the same the staff was unapologetic and started explaining how the victorian buildings tend to become smaller on higher floors when i was not buying the story they provided me the actual deluxe double room that is more comfy the staffs arrogance and lack of coordination is seriously needs to be looked at during all these commotion that manager didn t even bother to come out from his palace 
 nothing springs to mind i didn t take advantage of the breakfast deal portobello market was waiting so couldn t rate that 
 the most expensive and also the smallest room with minimal facilities that we stayed in for over a month in europe but hey that s london consistent with most other hotels in this area for the price 
 didn t dislike anything
 the rooms could be refreshed there s a different design on the photos than in reality also the airconditioner could be refreshed it was a bit smelly but fortunatelly we didn t needed so we could turn it off 
 room is quite small 
 pretty tight space tiny bathroom 
 room beside outside air con which came on and off during the night which was noisy breakfast very expensive at  when you could go across the road for  
 the bedroom furniture was a bit tired and the wash hand basin was cracked 
 was a bit a a walk from paddington not ideal when dragon a case
 we recived a groud floor room where the windows where located above the staff s smokeing area the hotel blocked the amount of money coresponding to one night payment from my creditcard an after  weak i still didn t reciveit back 
 noisy neighbour
 a socket for plugging your phone next to the bed 
 room was a bit tired the air unit or heater or whatever buzzed all night which was very annoying and storage closet space was limited london itself has become a tarpit foul air congestion and everything and i mean everything is so grossly overpriced the city probably tainted my view on the hotel somewhat but i will never visit london again other than perhaps in transit to somewhere more pleasant 
 the facilities were very basic breakfast was expensive and extra the location is a little out the way and the food offer is very basic the room was very basic bed was comfortable check out was a nightmare 
 nothing negative to stay the place is wonderful
 got moved to park grand paddington court and was allocated to the basement should have a choice of not preferring basement before
 i was expecting a delivery at the reception and despite having a confirmation of the delivery the night staff refused to give it to me arguing that it has never been delivered it is only when i ve threatened them to call the police that my package suddenly reappeared without the slightest apology outrageous i strongly advise you to chose another hotel if you have any concern for your belongings 
 the room for the price when i went through booking com i looked at the pictures under the room i was booking the room i got and the pics of the room was completely different ends of quality i m lucky i complained and they gave me an upgrade  pounds for this i wouldn t have paid  for it 
 nothing to dislike
 my only issue was at check in where the reception staff sought to take an imprint of my credit card using an old swipe machine although this was procedure i objected to any swipe of my card i am happy to leave holding deposit for additional costs but refused the staff to be fair didn t argue i have stayed at sister hotel without problem 
 breakfast is not very good especially the scrambled eggs were tasteless bedsheets very hard and itching skin was very rough afterwards for days please change your detergent
 i like to sleep with the windows open which meant i was disturbed by street noise in the early hours my husband is a heavier sleeper so heard nothing 
 air conditioning awkward to control would rather have been able to open a window especially while asleep 
 there was a terrible noise all throughout the night sounded like there were pipes rattling really loud every time i opened the bathroom door i could hear next door as thought they were in the room with us the hotel charged me a  retainer prior to arrival which i still havent been refunded 
 room was changed at arrival not sure how was the original one supposed to look like the one we got was a bit dated otherwise ok 
 they dont clean the room very well i give them  from 
 menu and lack of room service at certain times some rooms are really noisy you can hear full conversations of the people next door there are other rooms where a huge fan goes off outside the building needs better windows to keep the noise out 
 breakfast could be better more yogurt choices larger croissants more fresh fruit service was great there and in the bar cappuccino was bitter machine may need cleaning 
 rooms are very small hardly any space to move every day  small bottles of water be provided there should be atleast one more electric socket 
 the room is very very small the room was not cleaned daily so far from the stations tube and bus it s for sure not a  stars hotel as it s part of a residence building 
 went for a club room badly designed with bed base taking up way too much space making it hazardous in the night added furniture wasn t helpful and the only plug points were in the drop down desk tv could only be viewed from bed so two chairs were no use and neither was the formal desk bathroom was a wet room cubicle that soaked everything when in use as the shower curtain kept sliding away
 it was a very noisy hotel we were woken at   by the people upstairs walking backwards and forwards across the room and could hear toilets flushing etc we were in the basement no other complaints
 i booked a deluxe twin room as per the photos it looked good enough when we got into the room which was hardly m x m i thought i made a mistake because it had a king size bed with two single mattresses on it with  cm gap between them instead of two single beds we went to the reception to check they said this is the only available room and we can t give you your money back the room was so tiny we hardly had any space for our baggage staff all look unhappy the breakfast experience is even worse good staff but greedy greedy management and owners really bad experience 
 silly question nothing 
 they must have had experience with folk not paying due to the way they went on about payment by card being automatically taken for one night indeed payment seemed to be the focus and take priority when checking in not a real negative but after a hard day working in london after a long commute and turning up for a really nice relaxing experience left one feeling a little oh ok that s how it is then room was small and in the basement and you could see people walking right by on the pavement above while standing by the window when talking on the phone which i had to do since the signal was poor however it could make for an amusing gentleman s past time for someone else of course when the summer really kicks in and skirts get shorter they seem to pack rooms into that building and neighbours are easily overheard room was rather soulless and didn t have any character or charm at all there was a small long thin vase with  real carnations in which was a nice touch but it fell over and spilt the water on the floor due to the naff round metal glass table it was on being very un level as soon as i tried to move it out of the way of the pop out desk i mopped the water with a towel btw the air con was making a racket so i turned it off but a fan was still whirring and randomly screaming all night regardless despite consuming several pints at the mitre down the road in a solely medicinal attempt at ensuring slumber of any reasonable length i only got hrs sleep but i don t sleep very well in hotels anyway and use earplugs i was alone but the wife snores at home so is a habit so wasn t sure if the fan thing was enough of an issue to try and switch rooms during checkout i wasn t asked about my stay so didn t bother to mention it room  guys beware 
 service in the bar was slow at lunchtime when we ordered a salad another time we sat waiting for someone to come and take a snack order 
 my room was in the basement if i needed to stay more than  night that would make me feel uncomfortable i should have been told during booking that the room was in the basement 
 they assign you a different room then you reserved and lie in your face that it s the same one insects on on bedclothes they give you one towel for two guests the air conditioning was going crazy loud every  minutes during the night the room is so small it s hard to walk 
 the shower was cold and unfortunately so was the room the little heater provided didn t work at all 
  min walk from pasdington station my room was on  floor was a bit dark and very much noise from the outside the shower is just a hole in the floor so the floor of the bathroom is always wet
 we were made to move hotels because of hot water issues the mattress was yellow with stains if i had noticed this before the morning we certainly would not have stayed in that room i was informed the next day that they had thrown the mattress out it certainly couldn t have been cleaned the headboard was stained the staff were thoroughly unhelpful they couldn t even get me some new batteries for the remote control a second bed had been crowbarred into our room and made it impossible to open the fridge 
 boiler broken in first hotel had to be moved to a sister hotel then they got my room wrong putting me in a single with a broken telly
 street side a little noisy in evening but quiet after midnight wardrobe door with mirror on inside needs a hook to hold it open when using the hairdryer 
 booked via booking com and paid extra  to have the refundable option and to pay on check out however the hotel didn t inform me that before my stay they were going to take half the money out the week before my stay resulting in me nearly cancelling my card also i had to pay on check on no issues to either but should have been informed 
 rooms are small for a traveller of   bathrooms wet rooms are awkward windows need to be double glazed as constantly woken up during the night with deliveries etc outside aircon heating doesn t really work that well
 small room small double bed not what we expected from a deluxe room breakfast was not included in the price we paid on booking could have got a better price from the hotel including breakfast if booked direct 
 my security key to enter the door was disabled each time i returned which was frustrating as i had to walk back and forth to get the key activated 
 no wifi signal first time room was tiny spoke to reception moved to bigger room tap in the bathroom doesn t work properly
 room should have a fridge for fresh milk and soft drink storage soft drinks and better biscuits should be provided in the room
 there was no bar to speak of there was a fairly spartan room serving drinks but it wasn t conducive to having a nice drink our room was a bit cold and the heating didn t appear to work plus it hadn t been cleaned properly the bathroom bin was full of someone else s stuff 
 the bed was too hard the bathroom was tiny and the shower was not powerful at all the only mirror in the room was on located on the inside of the cupboard which didn t open fully so the mirror was not accessible the fridge didn t work properly all my drinks were warm the next morning 
 n a
 the air condition was noisy when on or off so interfered with my sleep there was also a little bit of a leak coming from the shower head the fire alarm had gone off as well could have done with  room keys as my daughter had gone off to do her own thing and so did i she got to the room before me so had to wait for me to let her in as i had the room key 
 there was a strange smell in the hotel and our room was next to a machine that make a lot of noise 
 the smoke alarm went off several times after am just because someone from another room had a shower and left the door open too noisy 
 plumbing quite noisy room not large enough to have a chair to sit in breakfast was additional and a little expensive 
 staff not overly very helpful or assisting on checkin about the hotel or facilities 
 the room rate is too high compared to the services provided the room service could have been better i stained my sheets with coffee and makeup on my first night and when my room was cleaned the next morning the cleaners failed to change my sheets 
 you could hear most things in the adjacent bedrooms and because there were no net curtains or light blinds and my window was facing the internal lightwell if i opened my curtains i could see straight into the bedroom opposite 
 no window in the room 
 i didn t like the very small window in the attic room made me feel a bit claustrophobic would have been nice to have a small bedside light for reading 
 room a bit on the small side and pillows a bit hard i run a guest house in cornwall you could cut your bread bill in half we were given  large slices of toast with our breakfast far too much if people want more they can ask for it also there is nothing worse than butter from the fridge that is rock hard 
 top floor was really warm had windows open the entire stay even though it was  degrees outside 
 even though we were told we had been upgraded the room was quite small 
 no control for heating small wardrobe space and nowhere to hang coats the room was very big though so not much of a problem 
 the bathroom was very small and had no actual shower cubicle or tray just a shower curtain and a drain it worked well enough but the addition of a shower tray would have made it much more pleasant to use 
 the staff on arrival weren t clear in fact one told me my booking wasn t with them and i was at the wrong hotel also at the time of booking i d been informed the room was paid when in fact it had only been reserved the staff were quite rude handling this situation when i got to my room i called for room service as i was shattered i was told by a member of staff that i couldn t order anything as the kitchen was closed she was rude in the manner in which she said this and this ultimately left me feeling frustrated i went out to grab something and used a plate within the room there was a can opener on top of the plate which was encased in food or remains of something this made me feel sick someone had obviously not checked the cleanliness of this area in some time great location staff could do with customer service training i would never stay there again 
 standards rooms are small but price is low for central london club rooms are decent size 
 the room was a little cramped but somewhat expected for london 
 bathroom a little small
 maybe the staff could have introduced themselves by name on check in the create a more personalised check in
 nothing to complain 
 the room was a little bit warm there was a fan in the room but it didn t make much of a difference 
 the room was too small we paid for a delux double but it was tiny the aircon system is also too noisy 
 their idea of separate beds was two mattresses  cm apart from each other with no possibility to move them the feedback form in the room was for some other hotel chain 
 the maid service was a little hit and miss glasses not cleaned replaced sugar not replaced there was no mobile signal in our room we paid extra for a club room but didn t really see any benefit the room itself was at the back of the hotel with no view apart from a wall and the only upgrades i noticed were  pieces of fruit and some rather scratchy robes 
 rooms was dated not particularly clean and with a very noisy air conditioning unit in the room when opening the windows because we were near the restaurant we had more noise from those units poor considering this was a deluxe room needed a complete refurbishment
 rooms were much smaller than i thought thought it was a star hotel and did not seem like it good thing i got a good price from booking com 
 couldnt fault it 
 the power in the room didn t work unless you gave the slot on the wall a bang the shower screen was half broken so a lot of water went all over the floor
 air con didn t want to work and room was freezing we had a little heaters but it took hours by the time room was nice and warm 
 we had a deluxe double room that on initial entry was dirty and in a poor state desk was broken and the tv didn t work properly not what i expected for a  star 
 room very small but only stayed one night not a big problem
 as already stated there was nothing that we did not like 
 checking the fridge for food and drink left behind would have been good a little more milk in the room would have been nice we weren t really there longer enough to request more 
 however i did not like how i went into the first room and the ceiling was all opened and i went to reception and instead of doing a room move straight away they doubted my word had to check first and then they moved me plus they knew it was a special occasion so they could be more careful with how they do things
 the location wasn t the best for where we were going but nice to be away from the centre
 slight mix up and had to go tongue sister hotel then the sent me back to the original as there was a problem with the original room room was stated as delux but was quite small
 check in wasn t available when we arrived at am however it wasn t really a big issue as we could leave our cases until we came back 
 i ll start off with the location was good for what we needed but it was freezing cold in the room all night i had to call to ask for extra blankets at am felt like i was camping outside had to call twice and wait minutes to get an extra blanket the room was an ok size but didn t expect our seperate beds to be together there was one plug outlet for the room as well which was frustrating the throw blanket on the bed was torn and stained as well so that wasn t very nice noise coming from upstairs and next door we only needed it for the night so i guess it did what i needed to do but i probably wouldn t stay there again 
 no phone signal in my room a bit small room even it s compact double room
  in this day age the fridge should be a standard however it was not as apparently only available in club rooms  no slippers or bathrobes either though they did provide the former on request after a little coercion  lat time i had booked a club room but it didn t have a proper shower area hence i chose the deluxe double this time by checking the bathroom pics beforehand however strangely this had some other items missing like the fridge bathrobes i just don t get it how does it all balance out 
 the room smelled of old cigars and the air conditioner blew cold and toxic air you over charged me for breakfast i was one person and was charged for two people
 furniture in club room very tired worn shower curtain fabric don t like this sorry and shower room very small tiles of wet room floor cracked too booked a double room enquired to see if i could change to twin but could only offer same bed base with  single mattresses so declined that when checking in was given twin room even though had asked for double to remain central reservations not easy to deal with on this 
 this is not a  star hotel in my opinion decor is worn out in places toilets in the main enterance for example where wood was exposed on the skirting breakfast although very nice was too pricy   room small they call it boutique but really it is just small the room we had had an enterance hall which was good for storing buggy ect but given that it was a room for a family with a baby access was on the first floor via a lift then we had to go down a flight of stairs to get to the door to our room no bt sport in room or bar so unable to watch a big champions leaugue match surely a  star hotel can afford to provide this for guests 
 air conditioning left room cool even when set to  degrees thin walls could hear man next door snooring
 we were on the very top floor when we got into the hotel room it was uncomfortable hot we had to phone down late at night and ask them to turn it down as we couldn t sleep had both windows wide open and the air con on the matress was uncomfortable it was rock solid we didn t get a full night sleep as we were too hot and very uncomfortable the second night in we were up watching tv and the electrics blew we had to phone down and get them to come and sort it which was very irritating afterwards the light over the shower did not work so overall not a good stay we would look elsewhere next time which is such a shame because it was such a lovely hotel and the staff were great 
 be aware that the sister hotel is just along the same road displaying a large park grand sign outside the staff are used to directing new guests to the correct hotel 
 there was a humming sound in the room in the nights and it was really small they start vid some reparing on out floor early in the mornings strong smell from spraypaint the toiletdoor is right by the bed rood staff in the reception both checking in and out 
 i didn t like the noise came when you switched the heating on at a certain temperature i didn t like not having much off a view from window looking on to other rooms
 air condition was noisy pillows were lumpy i changed the room twice but as you were full i had to have the first room anyway the second room was cold and the shower room floor icy 
 stayed in room  club room damp carpet by shower room noisy plumbing and a strange smell 
 the cupboard where the hairdryer was didn t open all the way around making the mirror on the inside impossible to use unless you leant across the table not a big problem just poor design 
 tv could have been a little bigger
 breakfast hall was located in basement restaurant so bit akward to find initially
 room was cold the heating was not efficient despite setting the temperature to c room was dark only small windows overlooking a wall m away internet was slow not enough for skype call 
 i booked a double room but it turned out to be  single beds pushed together we found it very uncomfortable also the beds had seperate single bed sheets on them so no effort was made to even make it appear like a double bed double sheets at least would have been a start breakfast instead of new unpealed potatoes chips would be better the sausages were undercooked and the beans were cheap i was really dissapointed when we returned back from breakfast we noticed that someone had came into our room and stolen a mars bar that was on the bedside cabinet it made it worse by the fact it was a double mars bar so someone had torn it open and taken half then just left the other half in the torn wrapper and left it on the table i reported this incident to the duty manager she said she would look into it i really do not expect this kind of thing to happen especially in a reputable place like this it s not the item itself that i m concerned about but it s rather the value of principle 
 i can t say anything bad 
 rooms are very small not a lot of space even in the deluxe double mirror is far from plug so could not straighten my hair shower door did not close properly too expensive
 the room was quite small and the view was quite bad but okay as we only stayed for a night
 to all weary travellers i booked a four night stay at the park grand hotel in london paddington having just arrived from a long journey and i checked into my room and went straight to bed not long after drifting off to the land of nod i awoke to a burning sensation severe itchiness to my upper torso neck hands and arms upon further inspection i soon discovered the bed was riddled with bedbugs and these free loaders i counted in the double digits after contacting reception i was greeted by the hotel manager and an assistant to assess the extent of the infestation by this time my bites had swollen to a collection of bright red bump the manager and equally his assistant were shocked at the state of the bed and they moved me to the room down the hallway the following morning i spoke to another manager to request a full refund for the previous night as well as requested relocation to a lower floor just in case my new friends decided to pay me another visit the manager advised me that a full refund was not practical and that the best they could do for me at the time was to give a  discount on the room which i did not accept for the previous evening and wash my clothes to prevent any stowaways at one point throughout the discussion the manager even intimated that i may be responsible for the infestation and that he would investigate the situation adding insult to injury this certainly did put me at ease and i did not feel like a valued customer instead of giving the hotel the benefit of the doubt and continuing my stay i requested that my room be cancelled and to refund the remaining nights as anticipated i was told that i should give  hours notice in order to cancel so i had to stay one more night before leaving to a neighbouring hotel i short the attitude of the hotel was woeful and the manner in which they dealt with their customers albeit the general staff was pleasant and helpful 
 everything was suburb i would consider myself a regular at the hotel and every time i go it is always great service
 the gym was good but i would have appreciated a yoga mat pilates ball and some more weights
 bathroom was teeny tiny but very functional clean so not really a didn t like more an observation
 poor wi fi connection we missed a cosy lounge there was no where to hang our winter coats in the room bathroom had not enough room for our toiletries and no toilet brush for a dane the bread at breakfast was not satisfactory only white and dry 
 the bathroom was a mess  star hotel with no shower cabine just a shower head and curtain that if you were not carefull flooded the whole room also our room was in the basement 
 smallest room i ve seen in a long time i booked a double deluxe room and it appeared to be one of the smallest rooms looking at the fire escape floor plan far from impressed 
 our room was in some sort of basement therefore the view was rather disappointing the window showed some kind of patio where the hotel staff walked through to get to the other rooms we had to keep the curtains closed for privacy this was not a really big issue 
 so called deluxe double room is claustrophobic it is overpriced but what isn t in london in addition on the web site breakfast was included in reality it s not 
 i was very dissapointed with this property our daughter booked and paid for this as a birthday present we had hassle checking in the receptionist wanted a copy of the card for security as this wasnt our card we didnt have it we offered our own card to use and they wanted to refund our daughters card which would take  days and take the money for the room from us there was no reason to do this and was a bad start to our trip also the pictures are very misleading the rooms were tiny i wouldnt return here but would definitely return to the area
 rooms are much smaller than they look in website booked a double room for a couple up on check in into room found only one set of things in the room one towel one coffee cup etc two calls to reception with  min wait to get things sorted 
 a bath in the suite is the only thing that would have made it better the hotel was further from paddington than we d expected
 unfortunately the room was too hot to sleep and the air conditioning could not cope with the heat 
 there are two of the same franchise in the same street so watch out for that this is the one at the corner of queens gardens
 room too small with tiniest bathroom very lengthy check in procedure which involved taking photocopies of my id and credit card for security and other reasons i was not happy about this and it doesn t happen at other hotels 
 bit strange being asked for photo id to check in i hadn t seen that when booking and just by luck i had my driving licence with me 
 room very nice but unfortunately the bed was quite dirty i know this is not the standard of this hotel but i had this unpleasant surprise on my last staying i m sure it won t happen again 
 no milk in room and called to say late check in and told at check in that my booking was about to be cancelled if any later 
 breakfast was poor and uninspiring with limited selection wouldn t bother with it next time also more expensive to buy it on booking com than at the hotel
 the only down side to the hotel is the beds and pillows first the pillows are like bricks i recommend taking your own pillow if you have to you wake up with sore red ears off them also the beds are not too comfy could be better i didn t want to think what our room would of been like without the free upgrade but overall for the price i paid which was  it wasn t bad as that included breakfast for  you can pay a lot more in london for the same service 
 this particular hotel has a chain of  buildings all in close proximity to each so was not sure if hotel we stayed in was one advertised also room given to us was on ground floor and curtains covered what was the old main entrance to building no double glazing so extremely noisey
 there was no hot water in the hotel so they moved us to another sister hotel down the road this hotel had tiny rooms noisy setup itchy sheets and in the middle of night a couple walked in on me as the reception gave them a key to my room didn t sleep well will not stay again
 second time i ve visited this hotel first time my husband and i were bumped this time when told they were moving me i stood my ground and insisted they gave me the room i d booked don t trust them no consideration for woman travelling alone you can imagine my shook and horror as  gentlemen came to check in next to me and were given rooms without hesitation or treat o f being moved my checking in experience was so upsetting i did not bother asking for help when my rooms heating wasn t working so i froze all night didn t sleep and felt totally upset when asked on checking out if i d had a good stay i said no and explained why oh sorry to hear that bye was the response i recieved from the polite but obviously not empowered reception staff beware of the dubious checking in policy 
 disappointed that the front desk could not accept a franked letter for posting one front desk person sent me to post box at paddington while the next day i was directed to a post box just down the street a seemingly insignificant thing but not when one is a visitor to a foreign land 
 we booked this through a third party booking com previously to that i had spoken to reservations of shatsbury hotels which indicated to me you have made a perfect choice for the location and purpose of your special occasion surprise to your partners birthday they also stated this is a wonderful boutique hotel and which would meet your needs for this occasion the lady also stated you can book through our selves or the third party if you decided you wish to book through us you will be offered breakfast included in the price how ever i decided to book through third part as the price was a better rate for our selves i had been in contact with the hotel manager and discussed possible arrangements and touches for my partners surprise on arrival all seemed okay had a coffee in bar why waiting for room to be handed over when entering the junior suite room i was astounded in how poor quality and damage of furnishings also dust and extremely cold as well as the cold feel to the room i unfortunately broke down to my partner and had to apologise i had been let down we then went down to reception and spoke with the manager sophia and explained our concerns of the room sophia said i can show you another room but it will be smaller and same quality as we re currently going a new refurbishment as of last week i explained i wish i had been told this before how ever sophia said i will get you moved to the hotel you stayed at before which is kensington park grande she spoke to reservations to find out and sort out thinking everything was under full control sadly it turned in to a disaster of a night mare i then took things in to my control by phoning reservations cut the long story short  hrs later still got know where really and by now my partner is currently not good health due to waiting for brain surgery has now got stressed and feeling dizzy and sick we went down to reception and finally the gm natish took us in to club lounge and spoke to us 
 the air conditioner seems not to work because although i adjust it to  degrees but actually i felt less than  degrees and it was cold during night also i booked for a double bed but initially it was  single beds next to each other once i asked for a double bed they just put something like mattress protector to cover the gap between the  single mattresses 
 i was dissatisfied with the fact that the shower floor was not sectioned off from the main bathroom floor there was no difference between the shower floor and bathroom floor so to speak 
 poor room service staff reception should be much more pleasant disappointed of their welcome guys try to smile even if the client can t speak english well room service worst one ever changing bed and putting same dirty pillows come on that s not a good service for london
 this hotel is supposed to be a  accommodation however given our experience it can be said it s no more than  we booked a deluxe twin room with  twin beds when we arrived there we got a twin room with one bed we told the front desk about this they reacted very customer unfriendly and told us there was no such thing like a twin room with two twin beds they also said that this was not their responsibility and that we should have booked from their own site and not with booking com because the information on their own site is supposedly correct we were very upset about their reaction and wanted to cancel the booking but the booking was already paid for and they said that we were free to go but they would not give our money back first they offered us to look for a room type we wanted in one of their other park hotels when we asked them to do this they took a step back and said that they would charge us extra for this so we had to accept the room anyhow they also said that they were fully booked and there was no other room available however on every online hotel site there was the possibility to book an room on the same day more interestingly we made the booking in euros and were charged more than  euros more than our initial booking without any explanation when we were settled in the room it seemed to us the room was very cold and that the heater did not work the heater was blowing cold air even that we set it on maximum heat temperature remarkably we discovered an electrical heating unit in the closet when we called the reception that the heater did not work they first said it was working ok and that we would have to wait to heat up that did not happen the room was only getting colder because the blower just blew cold air mid januari in london that is not nice we called again and finally somebody came and said there was indeed a malfunction however they told us not being able to repair it until next day 
 poor level of cleanliness in my room particularly around the bed and in the frame area of the bed cooked breakfast was also half cold and not very good 
 when we got there they told us no room left and try to send us to another unknown hotel and also asking pay first even tho we book one week ago there s no advance notice or apology explaination i basically stood next to the front desk and watch people check out so eventually got a room with tinny window and on the grand floor hearing people walk passing by 
 we were told at pm to keep quiet which was annoying as it was still early and then we got told we could use the club lounge and two minutes later got asked to go back to our room it was just annoying but i wouldn t say it s a place to go with a group of friends if you are planning a night out as it didn t suit us even when being quiet 
 room bed was a bit worn and windows allowed some street noise in so sleeping in was not really an option
 n a
 it would have been useful to have more plug sockets in the room to charge phones etc 
 the size of the room was very small no cupboard to put away clothing etc there wasn t any dressing table not enough room in the bathroom to display any toiletries 
 curtains as mentioned above 
 for the first timers the location would be confusing as there were many hotels in the same name of park grand in around the same location its hard to find your way back by walking if you forget the landmarks the bathroom is very small congested 
 i didnt had a bad experience
 very bad and small rooms payment sistem in hotel didn t accept visa electron card but before that when i booked room they accept 
 noise from everywhere in the hotel even uf someone walk un the upper floor or flush water in toilet breakfas is not good they gave us differen building becouse we whete told there is no water in the hotel well not stat again
 extra charge of  on leaving as they made a mistake when giving me price for room and breakfast a nice way to make extra money noisy water pipes no ear plugs at hotel reception
 air con was very noisy in the night even when switched off could hear tv in the room next door
 very compact room dark decor made room appear smaller location of hair dryer strange 
 there was a double and single bed in our room for  adults there were no rooms with three single beds so two of my friends had to share which was uncomfortable for them 
 the room was uncomfortably small when showering the water came through the bathroom door and got the carpet wet causing a bad smell
 air conditioning wasn t great where the hairdryer was situated in our room was convenient for the mirror you had to perch at the top of the bed to dry your hair as you couldn t detach the hairdryer to move it to a more convenient plug the mirror pulled out an angle to the bed the mattress was  smaller ones pushed together and this meant there was more bed stead than mattress and you found yourself walking into the sides of the bed all the time the shower door only opened half way which meant you had to manoeuvre between that and the towel rail on the right hand side which didn t leave much room whilst the style of the room was very nice the dark wood was very dark didn t like the fact i had to hand over photo id and the receptionist was unable to answer why when i asked only that it was hotel policy which is fine but why she took my credit card to confirm i was the one that made the booking my partner wasn t asked to show any id and what if i didn t have id would i not be allowed to check in despite me having pre paid the room not happy about this information being available hence why i requested the copy back on departure small bar facilities at the hotel with very limited choice of draught beverages 
 at first the room that was given to us was not the luxury double that was booked it was a very small room but the staff kindly moved us into a bigger room and apologised for the inconvenience 
 the second room for our family was not as close as we would have liked despite requesting rooms together staff were perfunctory and showed no interest whatsoever in us or in enhancing our stay in london when asked to call a taxi they arranged an uber car and the driver did not know how to get to the destination a tube station so my husband had to use his own phone to navigate expensive for what we got 
 my partner dropped a new earring in the bathroom sink and it could apparently not be retrieved without a plumber this would have cost us more than it was worth so it stayed in the u bend i believe it could have been accessed without much difficulty using a phillips screwdriver but who carries one 
 nothing
 the staff wasn t friendly when i was checking in she didn t even smile after that someone else was given the same room as us after we checked in then we cannot get into our room with the key 
 the fact that we were transfered to another building  minutes away because of maintenance issues the room and bathroom are very small in size the shower box is literally the size of a single cupboard 
 the evening receptionist desmond on the night of the th to the th of december handled a situation very badly when his colleagues earlier on in the day had given us permission to use the lounge room until pick up by shuttle to the airport at am he came to inform us that we could not stay in the hotel unless we book a room he apologized after upsetting us but it was a bit too late 
 disappointed that i couldn t cancel my breakfast but was offered a take away although i didn t have time for it i did take out an excellent coffee 
 i stayed twice so far each time in the standard double room once was in an attic and that room was a lot more tight for space than the other both fairly usually small for an inner city hotel room the attic room lights were bright with no lamp but the other room had better mood lighting 
 no bottle of water was available the hotel provide the tea and coffee without water no purpose 
 pretty much everything the dulux room isn t very dulux at all i could hardly walk around the bed that room is that small there no storage space for your bags etc they have one cupboard wide enough to fit a couple shirts it s about inch deep there s was stains all over the curtains and carpet the bathroom is a tiny wet room where you have no space to actually move around 
 too far from city central if you didn t know you have to have an oyster card for buses and your friend won t go on the tube no plug socket near a mirror 
 i didnt like the way a staff member handled my cancellation of one night as i had to cut my trip short because of a death in the family trainees should be taught to escalate more sensitive matters if they are not equipped to handle them 
 triple room is small not enough space for big luggages you have to squeeze in to fit and not enough variety of food in the breakfast lounge
 the first night i was booked to a tiny double bedroom  on the ground floor and unfortunately you could hear all night cars driving and pedestrians walking by also the room wasn t very good isolated and you could see the light from the corridor outside and the corridor door opening and shut also the housekeeping team must have had nearby their cleaning cupboards so from  am you heard loud voices and the vacuum cleaner going on the bathroom in this room was designed for a disabled wheel chair person which is ok but i felt it was a bit small and the shower was not warming up and the water pressures was low so it took ages to wash off soap etc however after i complained to the front staff about the noise and the water they put me in one of their club rooms which was better and the water pressure in the shower was good overall i stayed in the hotel for three nights and it was a good experience
 letter of complaint already written small room with nowhere to work no shower as such just a wet room and you could not open bathroom door to get in there
 nothing except the fact that room service is closing at am 
 it s true that they give booking com customers the worst rooms right by reception the bathroom was tiny not enough plug sockets and the shower wouldn t stop dripping the room was also freezing and had to ask for a heater 
 the rooms are very small and also booking com is very misleading the room did not have all of the listed items in the room the room was spose to be a deluxe but was more like a standard very disappointing and very misleading description of the room from booking com
 the only thing missing was there was no bath only a shower but it was a great shower the rooms were a little too cosey small 
 breakfast was disappointing would of been upset if i had to pay for it
 the rooms were extremely small and overpriced we asked to be moved from the first room as it was in the basement off the main corridor and what felt like a storage area very disappointed for the price being charged the second room was an improvement however still very small 
 the room i was saying was directly under the stairs and i could hear every footstep i didn t sleep very well as there was a constant disturbance i would suggest insulating that particular room to prevent the noise thudding through 
 at my arrival i didn t find the room even if the late arrival was written they just offer me a taxi for another hotel but i had to look for it they didn t suggest me anything 
 the rooms are very very small we only had  small suitcases and there was no room for them the breakfast isn t great we were given it complementary but would have been very disappointed if i d paid for it 
 absolutely noisy air condition they booked a deposit of one night that has not been resolved again upon payment mini bathroom not possible to shower without getting everything wet no wardrobe at all
 dreadful staff who would not help despite their booking process being unclear they need the card you book the room under to be present at check in which is useless for corporate bookings they will not take card payment over the phone or web because of fraud but would be happy to take a payment from the same card if you didn t turn up happy to leave two guests waiting in reception with no access to room whilst this was resolved really bad experience won t be booking again they also want to photocopy your driving license and bank card and try to tell you that you have to sign up to their loyalty club 
 stairs our room is located between the ground and the st floor so no direct lift access we had to carry our big suitcases from stairs gladly the hotel staffs were really helpful with our luggages the room was a bit narrow but perfectly acceptable given the price and being in london 
 no thing good on this hotel very small rooms we booked for room  m it was less of  m this not hotel but like one store of animals 
 small very small room 
 we felt the location was a bit far out from the main attractions however the price of the room was very reasonable which compensated for the taxi fares 
 the heater didn t work in the room called reception  times nothing done about it the toilet was also blocked in our room called reception to be told there wa no one that could help us until tomorrow morning so had to use the toilets in the hallway 
 not hotels fault but noise from idiots driving around cars middle of night with loud car exhausts
 that their system couldn t heat the room and i had to use a heater 
 the double room i was in was extremely small the bathroom was as well there is no possible way that more than one person could possibly stay in that room now i was there for business and i literally just slept showered and dressed there so there was no real issue but just understand what you are getting 
 everything were good only the bathroom is to small and the shower water doesn t go to the drainage straight away so it is wet everywhere and the cupboard is not functional hard to reach 
 i did not the like the reception staff as when there was a problem the resented the fact that there was one 
 bathing cubicle does not have sliding door hence we had to request for extra floor mat to prevent flooding 
 the rooms were small and the bathroom was a wet room which wasn t great especially as it was unexpected also not entirely sure we were given the deluxe double room we paid for 
 uuufhh where do i even start the rooms have no space you feel confined in them you can hear the person next door through the walls the hotel is a long walk from the nearest station the housekeeping lady kept coming into my room without knocking on my door she came  times between  and  noon her excuse she wanted to clean the room even though i told her not come in again the hotel should be  star and i don t know how they were rated  star perhaps it is self acclaimed i wouldn t advise anyone to go there you ll regret it and wish you hadn t a word they say is enough for the wise but these are alot of words 
 look at the curtains looks like blood stains all over even though it may be chemicals i hope also you pulled money ahead of time which i wasnt informed of as it stood that the full amount would be paid at the property 
 the first night we were allocated a basement room found this claustrophobic the staff who were excellent throughout moved us on the second night to a much better room on level
 lovely bedroom but no space to walk round my bed 
 steps leading from pavement to reception were awkward for a pushchair price of the breakfast lots of cafes within  minutes walking distance charging only   for a full english breakfast 
 room was not as described it was tiny in basement looked out to old ladders dirty curtains shower flooded floor soaking hazardous wet all round wc and whb this was not a deluxe room diningroom very pokey claustrophobic
 the room was small and gloomy with dark panelling and inconvenient lighting it looked out into a tiny well and was badly overlooked by another room so i had to keep the curtains closed more gloom i assume i was given the room because i was travelling alone but i booked for  people and i was paying the same as  people i don t appreciate being treated as a nd class citizen 
 may be the restaurant bar must extend the close hours 
 the double deluxe room was not like the picture it s very small and i felt like i was in a prison cell when i complained the staff did their best to upgrade me to a bigger room however i did feel like it was false advertising to begin with we requested one of the rooms to have  single beds they called this a twin room and made us pay  more for  nights however it was still a double bed or as they call it  single beds on one base not sure what the point of that is 
 got to the hotel we booked and needed to be moved elsewhere we were not happy with the hotel we were moved to as a group and this review reflects that hotel the montcalm 
 the location is far away in terms of walking to marble arch oxford and regent street there is a hotel almost have the same name with one word different in the end of the road which makes the taxis some times lost and confused not enough electric socket and not close to bed for phone charging the room is too small comparing to other hotels with the same class not recommended to families due to small rooms check there official website before book via booking com as some times you will find it cheaper and comes with breakfast 
 we had a problem at reception when we arrived which was never resolved to our satisfaction 
 room was tiny marginally bigger than the bed and more importantly there was no where to put anything be it my bag or even just a hair brush the bathroom is what is euphemistically known as a wet room meaning everything gets soaked when you have a shower you therefore have to plan your morning routine carefully unless you don t mind cleaning your teeth while standing in a puddle 
 the bathroom if it can be called that even honestly it is just a cubicle with no demarcation for the shower just a shower curtain that you pull across but that certainly does not help as for sure there is water everywhere on the floor when you shower we had to put down  towels to soak it all up as it s a mess they could surely have increased the size by cutting down on the seating area of the room it was really very tiny though we were in the club room 
 i didn t like that it took  other bad experiences in paddington before we found this one 
 i was setting in the reception reception staff they are not respecting the customer they are saying to some customer at  clock you can get the key and other giving them the key when i spoke to her she said we have categories i told her i know you have categories when first customer came i kept quite because they are  but when you allow for other single customer to get the key that mean there is no management and no respect for customer and that not fair she didn t give me any answer just said wait  min it will reach  and you will get the key after  min asking me to get the they how she arranged they faster the reception is the front of the hotel if the employee s behavior is abusive the owner will be looses my evidence hotel camera 
 an unpleasant smell in bathrooms due to style of plumbing and in some rooms wet room means that bathroom floor can be rather wet 
 very big problems with payment by bank transfer problems with extension our stay at hotel shame because hotel is ok 
 the wardrobe and the hair dryer were a slightly inconvenient to use but it s manageable for a few days stay 
 incorrect payment my credit card was charged twice first time on the arrival send time when we leave when i found this i tried to get my money back it is already almost  days  emails written and still did not get my money back never go there again 
 got a basement room with no natural light tiny room tiny wadrobe inside a wall and they could do smth with unused space from the entrance to the room 
 the size of a double deluxe room was small and i had rather claustrophobic impression no fulfilment of my preliminary request the bathroom floor gets totally flooded one chair only in a double room the same foods served in breakfast evryday and poor choice 
 there was nothing to complain about 
 toilet seat had hair on it the two rooms were not very close together and they were rather cramped 
 the room was tiny to put this into perspective we are two  yr old females who have travelled quite a bit and have used various standards of accomadation from hostels upwards so it s not like we re accustomed to luxury i ve also been in london a number of times so i understand hotel rooms are small in general knowing this we paid a bit extra for a deluxe double as it was supposed to have more room but the bed was a standard double in size and there was only bare walking room on one side and at the end and you could just about stand on the other side of it we actually found it massively amusing trying to figure out what was deluxe about the room 
 we had to change rooms as the ac did not work and they did not fix it staff could hardly understand english and i thought i was in london but english is not the language 
 reception staff very poor service not friendly not helpful i feel we got fooled with a few things only because the staff in the reception didn t inform us about things like if you prebook your breakfast at the reception the day before is only  not more as we got charged when we went down in the restaurant if you ask them to call you a cab they call you a private kind of a chauffeur service which is more expensive then the usual london cabs etc we booked a room for  people in a small room there was a double bed and a very uncomfortable sofa one of us had to sleep on that on the sofa also had a few issues with the charges on my credit card in the hotel they were not helpful they didn t give me any explanation they gave me an email to email them i wouldn t trust them again with my credit card 
 wish the rooms were a bit bigger we booked a triple room they gave us the one facing the back of the hotel which was very claustrophobic it was so bad we were going to leave the hotel but then they showed us their other triple room which faces the front street of the hotel and that was much better but generally very claustrophobic rooms my teenage kids didn t like it as they need their space 
 the room was too small bathroom sink was clogged and electrical sockets did not work so i could not charge by mobile phone i changed my hotel to grand park court around the block 
 tiny room and i mean tiny literally just enough room for a bed lipstick on wine glasses  days in a row so not cleaned properly air con has one setting only arctic and loud 
 terrible gym kitchen people smoking right outside this tiny gym with windows open into gym and terrible smell of cigarette very expensive for what you get and also not on par with other  stars 
 had to ask for complimentary items that should have been included in our room hairdryer situation was poor couldn t see in a mirror without being a contortionist no explanation of facilities and their location
 extremely small rooms though not surprising for central london you can barely move within the ground floor rooms either misleading pictures on booking com or the hotel gave us their smallest rooms knowing we re travelling with children 
  the steep steps leading to my room  the lack of a cloth to cover the bread stick as you cut it thus your hand and anyonelses was placed on the end of the bread to steady it as you cut 
 upon check in i was asked to move to a sister property apparently my room was under rennivation the sister property room was a shoebox size they miraculously found a room for me at the first hotel and the room was extremely small incredibly dirty i will not be back i checked out after one night and paid a penalty fee i will not be back 
 i booked a double deluxe room here online but when i got there they gave me a small room the size of a closet because it was available first even though i had paid the price point for a double deluxe room  pounds a night they then transferred me to a slightly bigger room that still wasn t a double deluxe and looked nothing like in the pictures staff were rude and reluctant to help whenever spoken to and at one point in the lounge area we witnessed one of the staff giving a young hotel guest a loud and stern lecture about payment the whole exchange was very uncomfortable and unprofessional for  pounds night  canadian dollars we would have gotten a spacious room in other countries with wonderful service but here i felt like i had thrown a bunch of money down the drain 
 they changed us two times from one hotel to another when we arrived they offered us complimentary breakfast the drawback is that the bathroom was very small and it smells bad sometimes 
 deluxe double was a small room interior was back to the s tv was small and hardly viewable front line staff were great but the managers appeared as honest as arthur daley no room for luggage bathroom too small
 reception was a nightmare when we arrived they put into a room which not what we ordered and they were more concerned with taking our money than providing a service treated us like b grade guests because we had booked using booking com we asked them to book a taxi for us on departure and they booked a cab for the wrong time would not stay there again 
 the room and bathroom shower was very small and quite claustrophobic 
 rooms are slightly small so if you have a big luggage hard to move and no space to unpack some of the stuff had an attitude i had a big window in the room but looking to back side of the street so no nice view 
 the room was a club it was ridiculously small in that it was a struggle to walk round the end of the bed anyone more than ft  tall would be struggling with the low ceiling height the bathroom was a toilet basin with a shower which had a curtain ridiculously small it is not a wet room the mattress dipped in the middle so an uncomfortable  nights sleep overall we felt that we had been charged a lot more than it was worth as a regular genius booker with booking com we ware disappointed not to have been alerted to these problems as we would have stayed elsewhere 
 we had asked for a nice room as we were celebrating our  month wedding anniversary but we were given a room down in basement level which obviously meant no view then the bed consisted of two single mattresses pushed together on a wooden base which was far too big for purpose the room was smaller than we expected to get for the  we paid for the two nights also the shower tray is pretty much on the same level as the bathroom floor so if you re in the shower any longer than a couple of minutes the bathroom floor gets totally flooded all in all definitely not worth the money we paid 
 unfortunately there was not enough storage space in our room one small hanging space and two small bedside drawers is not enough for a stay of three nights it meant that we were not even able to partially unpack our cases i would have liked more space for our personal toiletries in the bathroom as well 
 not the room type we ordered and paid for two very single mattress made up individually on a king size wooden bed base does not equal a double bed room was nice but not in our opinion a deluxe 
 rooms are too small not enough or to be correct almost no wardrobe space and a useless entry space without even a few hooks that area could be used at least to hang your coat hat or a few stuff
 a room with a broken and leaking shower should not be given to guests neither the reservation system nor the receptionists do understand that a female guest s family name can consist of two parts like maiden name plus husband s name while the respective husband has just one name this lead to the problem that an important parcel has not been accepted for which my husband was eagerly waiting instead it was sent back by the receptionist 
 despite  days ill health notice the hotel would not consider changing our reservation to another date and our full nights accommodation was forfeited
 nothing
 the rooms provided were small we had to upgrade for the bigger rooms credit card details provided at time of booking via booking com was debited even though payment for the ris were made upfront this was only refunded after  hours blocking credit unnecessarily 
 small room and the slow inprofessional response from the staff for the room a c problem despite complaining three times about it which took them two nights to move me for another room with a properly working a c unit 
 the toilet was very small on the day we checked in the walk in price was less than what we paid on booking com i would definitely call the hotel to check the price before booking 
 the room was awful too small very claustrophobic awful view
 rooms were not as advertised although clean and well maintained rooms were a bit run down rooms were very small for the price hardly room to dwing a cat management were not responsive to requests for change had the feeling of being conned 
 rooms not facing street look to back alley and backs of old buildings one of our rooms had funky location down steps off the main hallway very small bathroom 
 we had arranged to have a continental breakfast my husband changed his mind when checking out the manager charged us the difference for  people having a full english breakfast when challenged and asked for a receipt the manager rudely passed threw the receipt to my husband my husband asked he why he did it and was ignored a sad ending to an otherwise very enjoyable stay 
 the size of the room is definitely smaller than the description befor arriving they informed us that the room we booked had something wrong so they will transfer us to their sister hotel which is two minutes walk we rejected and the first night they arranged us to a room at basement floor which was horriable i think it is because of overbook the hotel is not very clean and at the th day the toilet flush button also didn t work well 
 the room we had was in basement so no phone signal which was a pain
 the walk in shower as the floor was always flooded 
 there was absolutely no insolation between the room and corridor i was woken constantly through the night especially with people coming back in the early hours of the morning and arguing for several hours i travel extensively and this is the worst hotel i ve stayed at due to the noise factor 
 the experience was very bad staff unprofessional especially the reception bad bad bad room service this hotel dont deserve to be  stars at all max   stars 
 the bathroom was ridiculous there was no tub or shower door just a curtain and a drain in the middle of the floor so when you showered water soaked the entire bathroom floor surface 
 initially we were provided with two very poor rooms neither had curtains only blinds which did not close properly the compact room was extremely small and had a musty smell the deluxe double could in no way be described as deluxe among other things the carpet at the entrance of the shower room was very wet 
 the rooms were incredibly small and cramped we struggled to even get through the door to our room the rooms were not clean there were very big brown stains on the carpet the hotel is dated and the fixtures including the thermostat were falling off the wall in some cases 
 the water didn t drain well the desk staff were sour faced do they not enjoy their job

 the room is so small and it had lots of dust the door cannot lock i also requested for the upper storey room but i got a basement room 
 the extra bed in the room
 not only did the staff on arrival ask to copy the details of my credit card this is ok but they also noted down the cvv number from the back of the credit card this means that the hotel has all the information to use my credit card for internet purchases since this is unacceptable i asked the receptionist to delete the cvv but she refused this policy should be changed otherwise good hotel 
 n a
 the sauna is a wonderfull addition it s a shame i had to slalom in the cleaning staff halway almost filled with cleaning products also the proximity to the cleaning staff s room added all the noise to what was supposed to be a quiet moment maybe it would be a good idea to relocate their general quarter 
 they have maintenance and i couldn t enjoy the balcony view 
 reception not impressive building was under construction room passage was way to small room has also no space
 lift wasn t working to th floor as under maintenance room service dinners aren t the greatest 
 i didn t liked that spa and massage rooms were under maintenance breakfast was a bit overpriced euro per person just for a breakfast just outside there are few restourants that had main course and dessert for same price 
 nothing to declare 
 no gym as its being refurbed which was not clear on the site apart from right at the bottom also i was not allowed to then change hotel after i discovered this when i brought it up with the staff in the morning who were a little short i was then emailed far to late saying i could change but by that time i was already at work also you changed the price of the booking the second night to add insult because of demand which apparently was on the site too absolute joke how you can get away with that 
 the rooms are small but hey it s paris
 due to the tightness of parking you re requested to leave car keys with reception so they can move cars if necessary i was blocked in as the owners didn t leave their car key though the manager did manage to get round this the sound proofing wasn t great as i could hear the people above me talking non stop from am 
 could improve on breakfast items grapefruit juice was not fresh anymore scrambled eggs not enough cooked 
 room was small as only slightly larger than bed themed rooms with photos of american icons was strange for being in paris costly to be expected in paris though 
 very small room for the price they charge 
 breakfast was expensive so i didn t take it 
 room size
 busy area meant loud mornings outside 
 room is small price is too high compare with the equipment and service for the room i booked 
 room dimension
 wifi was very poor 
 expensive breakfast
 the hotel is situated in the worst area of paris as the black cab driver i used from outside the station informed me as he charged me five times the going rate for dropping me there the kube hotel is situated up a dirty side round with timber boarding across the front in the day and   doorman in the evening the ice bar in the hotel looks nothing like the advert on their website 
 location not far from gard de nord otherwise somewhat out of the way until we found our way around the metro which was good breakfast not impressive little choice coffee not hot bar had limited opening times closed early so no customers no atmosphere d cor seating was good so if the management put some effort into it would do a lot better ice bar was a great novelty but at c we didn t fancy it perhaps next time we will brave it also a kettle in the room would be helpful 
 the showers in the rooms are awful not enclosed with just a tap extension on the wall which is too low and the water sprays everywhere
 the location wasn t the best but it was real close to the metro which got you anywhere you wanted in minutes so it wasn t so bad 
 limited food available from the reception bar 
 booking com advertised my room as having a bath however it didn t the tv didn t work meaning the wifi didn t work advised staff of both issues and received no offer of resolution acted as though because it was a last minute booking due to eurostar cancellation that it was my problem and i should just make do very sub standard
 worst hotel ever awful location bar and restaurant closed all  days we were there non existent receptionists and tv reception was variable had junior suite but no robes no proper shower either 
 no proper light over bathroom mirror bathroom open to room nightclub feel to corridors floor in foyer worn and didn t appear clean breakfast was set up there and with the black decor was not very inviting we took our breakfast out into the courtyard the breakfast buffet was okay but the cheese was in a container which had previously been used for a fish buffet a whiff of old seafood at breakfast the corridors walls were covered with a black fake fur 
 i didn t feel very comfortable around the area and the fact you could hear people outside the room most of the night as well was not the best 
 very bad experience as i lost more than  euros it was stolen from my bag i just knew when i arrived back 
 toilet not clean on arrival no shower curtain shower fixture loose bad smell in room 
 very bad area in the station neighborhood staff couldn t speak english so it was extremely difficult to communicate lack of communication among staff which forced me to repeat things to each member of staff it took me  hr to check out 
 we didn t have a bad experience but the location seems a little unsafe at night wlking in the day is fine but i would be more inclined to take a taxi at night there were a lot of youths and homeless out drinking this is unfortunately out of the hands of the hotel 
 fitness club was out of order which was the only reason i booked this particular hotel for the price the staff were vague about the situation and it never got fixed during our  day stay and there are no parks nearby for running there were some strangely quirky aspects to the room layour that didn t make sense like a shower with no door or curtain which left an inch of water on the bathroom carpet there was no drain in the floor and all of this meant we could only take baths all week 
 the noise and the neighbourhood
 first day cold water and no breakfast localization very bad on a dangerous zone 
 gym
 very bad location very shabby area staff did not speak good english so very difficult to communicate
 hotel closing for refurbishment most of the staff being sacked future of the hotel likely to be expensive with new staff they are losing their best asset 
 some of the ground floor spaces needed a facelift which they are now undergoing 
 hotel facade works 
 the bedrooms are very tired and a bit grubby looking air con and extractor were broken 
 hotel not up to scratch in certain areas it will close for refurbishment shortly so hopefully it will sort a few problems out 
 under going renovation which i wasn t made aware of room comfortable but tired 
 place is really old cramped and dirty even dirtier than london in general there was a smell in the room i was initially put into and another smell in another room i asked for 
  the hotel was redecorating it was not like the pictures shows it can be barely recognized  it was a long way from elevator to my room lots of doors just imagine you are carrying one or two suitcases and you still have to open the doors again and again when you walking through a very long way besides nobody is intending to help you terrible experience  the in room breakfast was not on time i was almost late on the morning  very old decorations not clean enough  it was definitely not worth for the price 
 noise from the air conditioning units we may not be able to afford a room once the improvements are completed
 we had no complaints whatsoever 
 double room was small and in need of a freshen up also woken up a am when a noisy generator fired up outside our room this may have something to do with all the building work that is going on at the hotel but when you have had a late night that s the last thing you want 
 sink in bathroom extremely small we were asked for our champagne to room and didnt appear so had to get on check out also found it very disappointing to be asked to pay for room service on the spot and not able to put on room bill we were very offended by this we have stayed in hotels all over the world and never been asked to do this before in fact had returned from a wonderful holiday in hong kong just the week before and had room service and paid on check out would appreciate some feed back on this matter
 nothing at all 
 i have stayed at the hotel at least half a dozen times over the past three years the rooms are getting tired and worn the front desk staff are indifferent i tried to break a  note at front desk so i could tip the waitress in dining room at breakfast they told me to do it myself at one of the nearby restaurants major exterior renos going on outside hotel i hope they are going to upgrade the rooms as well i think it is time that i try another hotel 
 light outside of the door shines through spy hole and the door frame unable to turn it off crazy i am a returning client make more of your existing client base 
 had to go to local shop for fresh milk as not available from housekeeping staff one awful sandwich in the bar shame really as other food very good 
 the first room we were allocated had a musty smell to it but we were efficiently moved across to another room with no bother at all some areas need updating but this was already underway in some parts of the hotel shower was very noisy 
 i had requested a quiet room given room on the th floor air conditioning not cooling room but extremely noisy room very hot blocked bath drain shower faulty water filling the bath from the bath tap while shower on requested room change given room on nd floor windows blocked out no daylight extreme noise from continual external exhaust fans between am until pm worst sleep ever old noisy air conditioning system also hotel undergoing major building works not advised of this when booking i booked for  nights and wanted to cancel the last night to go elsewhere but hotel unable to advise about cancellation as i had made the booking through booking com 
 the bed was huge plenty of room but the mattress was extremely hard and slightly bowed both my husband i had an uncomfortable nights sleep woke in the morning with aching backs which was a first for both of us 
 see adjacent box 
 the room was a bit small but that s a function of the hotel maintaining the victorian style we liked work on the hotel was in progress while we were there so the machine sounds in the lobby were deafening at times 
 room and hotel generally were a little dark pillow was lumpy decor and furniture a little tired 
 seems like room would be very hot in summer air conditioning did not cool room very much when i used it but not a real issue in june 
 the rooms are dingy and in serious need of an upgrade with chipped furniture and old fittings 
 the hotel was being renovated which gave it a slightly run down appearance the sink in our room was cracked and there was no hair conditioner available in the hotel the television was very small and dated 
 n a
 we had a small claustrophobic room next to the noisy road with a questionable air con system and the shower did not work an engineer failed to repair it and after several cold showers we were moved to a new quieter and better room the next day and were compensated for the inconvenience 
 shower was a bit different to work taps slightly broken and the tap you pull up was broken 
 we chose that hotel because of its locations but the room was an interior one and the view was awful which was very disappointing interior rooms shouldn t cost the same money the windows weren t closing and some parts need refurbishment 
 after checking out i left my luggage at the concierge however when i returned i had to wait or over  minutes before i got my items as the concierge was elsewhere this resulted in me nearly missing my train 
 hotel has clearly done a deal with golden tours bus tours we asked the concierge if he could recommend us a good bus tour he sold us tickets for the golden tours busses the tour was abysmal and not worth the time or money we spent on it breakfast was poor just a buffet food was a bit cold luckily we hadn t had to pay for breakfast bc the hotel had made a mistake with our room so they gave us free breakfast in return but if we had paid i d have been complaining about the breakfast to the staff in charge 
 there was no water in the room and we had to pay  for two bottles from the bar 
 we couldn t shower bath the cold tap fell off bathroom very cramped would be better off with just a shower in there breakfast was awful dried up bacon mushrooms eggs weren t any better drinks very expensive we did complain and were given a refund
 the air conditioning was pretty useless and didn t cool down the room as it was located on the floor and not on the ceiling and it was very warm in the room 
 they charge a fortune for breakfast use the caf s surrounding the park instead cheaper and nicer for working not very good comfort the desk and chair in the room is very uncomfortable to sit and work with 
 rooms and bathrooms larger and better air conditioning 
 breakfast was horribly overpriced we were offered option for reduced rate of we bought breakfast every morn of our visit but we couldn t do this because we had to leave early the day we departed 
 the fire drill that takes place every monday at   pm after a transatlantic flight we were asleep when the alarm went off 
 nothing really
 the bed was extremely uncomfortable the mattress is very soft to the point where if you aren t sleeping in the middle of the bed you might fall off of it i woke up with back pains as well we ended up switching hotels because of it there was no dresser to put your clothes in which was also kind of a bummer other than that the hotel is old so if you like something modern it s not that personally that didn t really bother me 
 not unique to the russell but i dislike being charged a discretionary service charge of   and also asked to leave a gratuity on the bill 
 rooms very tired and badly in need of refurbishment air conditioning did not work bathroom very small lifts very small 
 the shower didn t work properly the bathroom was tiny and it wasn t easy to get out of the shower a shower cap would have come in useful 
 i loved this place they are renovating some of the hotel and so it will be even nicer 
 hotel is very tired we had a twin bedded room which faced an interior courtyard windows very dirty outside tiles in the bathroom needed grouting room service extremely limited 
 the shower leaked under the door into the bedroom and the bathroom floor was also very slippery the bedroom was far too hot and couldn t be cooled down 
 my room was on the road side of the building extremely noisy with ambulances racing down the road dining room not open when on one night i stayed i was not informed of this on checking in 
 some of us found the frequent sirens of ambulances heading for the nearby great ormond street hospital disturbing in the nighttime 
 no shower cap shower gel or conditioner insufficient milk and coffee air conditioning so noisy that it was unusable fridge not working food in restaurant very average quality drinks very expensive threadbare carpet on stairs 
 friendly concierges were helpful but weren t actually familiar with many of the sites or transports inquired after they went online to find out 
 nothing it was a lovely but small room in london with a good view but had everything we needed would definitely stay again 
 building is old and has a very small lift however great staircase 
 more choice for room service both food and drink to suit todays traveller more tv film choices as currently limited 
 the hotel russell is one of our favourite london hotels but our room this visit was quite small and there was no view at all from the window but it was very good value we booked quite late and it was a busy weekend 
 got a room over the hallway from major refurbishment that woke us up in the morning got the room changed with very little fuss 
 the pillow too big for me therefore my nights were uncomfotable i was obliged to use the red decorative cushion 
 it s a tired old building we had problems with plumbing a c didn t work elevator is so tiny two people plus luggage fill it up windows didn t open there is no business center to print airline tickets overall it was expensive and there are other choices nearby at the same or lower cost 
 we spend  nights in three different rooms we were moved twice due to very very poor quality rooms this is a lovely looking hotel from the street with marvellous staff and a great position but a hotel that is well over due for a complete makeover i would suggest for the price to stay at the russell you could do much better elsewhere
 the room  was not up to the standards of a   star hotel mattress too hard not enough wardrobe space noisy bathroom would have been ok in  
 air conditioning unit didn t work and it was a hot night on saturday with quite thick duvets on the bed also the bathroom was very compact quite a tight squeeze to get to the sink and mirror 
 i m not usually one to complain but the bathroom towel rail was permanently on and extremely hot the sink in the bathroom was very small being on the first floor was extremely noisy in the morning and i was awakened early it was very hot in london this weekend and the air conditioning was broken making the room uncomfortable at times i was also unhappy that i d left some change out on the side in the bathroom and when i returned on sunday evening that money had disappeared i know this is a small thing and it wasn t a great amount of money but it still should not have been taken another gripe was that a wine glass from the night before was not taken away the next day either 
 i wonder why we could not choose the table when we had a breakfast is it separated by race or rank of room we are japanese i hope not this is the first hotel which the staves designated our table and the tables we were shown were not so comfortable besides i would like to request to improve the breakfast and about our room honestly i regreted not asking to change another room i wanted have stayed my mother at the room which is better lighted and better view even if i paid extra fee because it was my mother s last  days of staying in london 
 needs a bit of tlc but overall a very nice hotel noisy aircon generators outside the room view was actually of them but it is london and we paid around  for just bed no breakfast which in london is reasonable 
 the room was tatty and well worn with gaps in the fitting of the windows and a really very poor standard of maintenance 
 the room i booked was for my partners birthday surprise and was nice but a little small the package i booked was rose petals and bottle of bubbles on arrival which was lovely the one on the website was a lot larger or an excellent camera shoot luckily i don t get up in the night but if i had of the space between the wall and the bed would of been interesting as very tight 
 st room too noisy opposite  pubs nd room plumbing problem no refrigerator rd room wifi signal too weak in room no refrigerator 
 the rooms on the th floor are very small and unless your ft  you ll have to squat to get underneath the shower head 
 small small room first room air did not work however they did change our room the next day
 happy with everything
 more shelf room needed in the bathroom was my only critism 
 room sheets could ve been cleaner 
 nothing 
 building work during the day but this can t be helped 
 nd floor noise from street level but i can deal with that bed is uncomfortable old spring not a good night sleep as a result shower pressure was not great overall the particular room we had could be the exception 
 there was nothing i did not like
 drilling started very early in the daytime for the ongoing refurbishment
 i was advised that the restaurant was closed on sundays which was a pity as the friend i was meeting and i would have liked to eat there the only thing missing was a bathrobe i d have enjoyed a bathrobe subsequent hotels during my trip all had them but the hotels themselves weren t as good 
 how to get cold water in the bathroom is and remains a mystery breakfast variety of fruits and kinds of breads is limited 
 horrible mattresses sprung chairs pathetic bathroom supplies staff were grumpy and poorly trained interiors are depressing 
 the value rating vs money that you get cannot be acceptable for a star hotel we were given a room for a single that the adjective tiny does not represent how small it was transformed to get a couple in a  star hotel that is far from acceptable after complaining twice since the first time they got us another tiny room we finally got the expected room the images of the hotel s rooms are far from being the real deal a disappointing experience 
 never got washcloths 
 nd bed in our double accommodation was a sleeper sofa and the mattress was sheer torture 
 check in was terrible we arrived about  pm and it took us   hours to get the room 
 quite some noise came from machinery in the courtyard through closed windows even at night 
 room service menu is a little limited having said that there are numerous eateries on your doorstep parking not on site but close by 
 bar prices a bit steep but did sort of expect it being such a classy hotel
 not enough towel hooks for two people nowhere to place tooth brush and toiletries near sink 
 the building is old and the decor shabby what you see on the booking site isn t the room you get our room was small carpet worn windows filthy and a tiny bath with a tiny tv 
 could have done without a visit from a man to check the blinds once we d checked in the roman blind didn t work very well room was slightly smaller than one would expect for the money and a little tired 
 room rather hot airless window with obscured glass into internal courtyard didn t open aircon not very effective only one set of shampoo soap etc 
 epensive unless you get a special fare
 bathroom a little small  but they are updating rooms shower did not work properly kept going hot and cold it may have had something to do with the workmen next door but we managed 
 the biggest issue for me and my group with this hotel is the fact the staff do not appear to have a good command of english and this was hugely frustrating not only did we stay but we had a huge meeting there with them too it was starting to drive us insane them not understanding simple instructions from us forgetting refreshments etc there is a lack of attention to detail at this hotel too and i do think the language barrier plays a big part in this for this reason alone i sadly will not be coming back 
 the rooms are in the process of being refurbished but there were holes in the carpet in my room 
 the prices in the bar were very high the dinner menu was mainly just pub food the long walk to the bedroom from the elevator 
 very small bathroom a larger person would not be able to get to the sink given the proximity to the shower screen on the bath 
 the room on level  was above air conditioning units so sleep was not do great as we had to have the window open because it was very hot in the room we was moved to this room after we refused the other room on level  because the windows did not open
 it was all good our family room which i booked was unavailable so the manager gave us two separate rooms and complimentary breakfast customer service was first class
 the room was quite small and the windows not insulated so outside noise and cold air were factors
 on arrival the doorman asked if i could get out my wheelchair and climb the stairs as the lift would take too long for him to set up 
 view of an inside courtyard room virtually furthest from entrance good exercise for the price and given the lead time booking i expected a view of london breakfast way below par for a hotel of this stature book in took all of  minutes as staff struggled to find us a room despite a  month lead time
 we would return to the room after a day out on the city and housekeeping would not have cleaned our room yet at   in the afternoon and we d have to leave for  minute once housekeeping finally came by 
 my husband was accused of smoking in room he hadnt thy put a letter under our door and took  out of my account without permission  conversations later they reumbersed monies but it ruined it for me as i was very upset about it they made us feel like criminals and didnt give us a chance to defend ourselves our friend who we met whilst in london is a barrister and was appalled when we told him 
 my room was cancelled a few days before and i was given a room with a poor view but what made it worse was the fact the windows were dreadfully dirty and it was only the second floor made the room grubby also the step into the bath was extremely high 
 check in was frustrating our room had been allocated to someone else which we found out when we tried to access the room rooms were generally small and not clean to the standard expected for a  hotel in general i felt we paid more than we should have for what we got 
 bedroom needed redecorating poor storage facilities bath very small noise from workmen along corridor early morning deliveries below window
 unfortunately i got a room next to the kitchen extractor fan which was very noisy room  by the way the first night it stopped at  p m so that was all right but the second night it did not so i hardly slept at all however when i mentioned this at checking out i was compensated with having my breakfasts taken off the bill and promised a free upgrade next time i come so i ended up feeling more pleased than i had thought i would be i have stayed at the russell several times before after my sleepless night i thought this was the last time but because of the way my complaint was dealt with i will certainly return 
 uncomfortable bed small room windows requiring repair and were drafty and noisy and the room decor was extremely dated 
 the extractor fan in our room didn t work the window in our room didn t open and as the room was small the poor ventilation was an issue especially when the shower was on also there were no extra sockets so charging our phones etc was difficult we moved to a different room on the rd night of a  night stay so at least the last night was better but st and nd nights were disappointing 
 tired room with peeling wallpaper stained furniture cracks all over the room the duvet was lumpy however they fixed this right away the iron didn t work very well extremely cramped toilet as in the sink fitted just over the toilet seat had to be a contortionist to use it however it was clean 
 we had booked superior rooms but they were unavailable however the hotel gave complimentary breakfast and bottle of wine 
 would have liked bigger room and one with a view but you don t go to london to sit in your room breakfast good but a little expensive 
 didn t like being woken up an hour before needing to be woken up especially at  am
 despite the grand public spaces the rooms are rather tired in terms of d cor and furnishings and really need to be torn apart and modernized the windows are grubby and haven t been cleaned in years after coming from a four star hotel in valencia that was exquisite in every respect i realized i had returned to shabby britain 
 automatic   tip added to everything why do companies do this it gets right up my nose leaves you feeling either ripped off or nowty for asking for it to be removed such a shame would have been  out of  otherwise 
 the saturday evening bar staff were fairly busy and less attentive than usual the air conditioning was very noisy we opened a window to cool the room but then of course there was noise from outside the bathroom was small fortunately we are small people but even so the space is small for even one person i really do not like the glass doors on your bathrooms less privacy and the light from the bathroom is intrusive if someone is asleep 
 room was very tired feeling walls and skirting needed a good sand down and coat of paint rust damage down back of hand basin clearly visible from toilet 
 the bedrooms are tiny but saying that we weren t in the rooms a lot 
 front desk receptionist was extremely rude programmed my key card incorrectly my room was in a far corner of the hotel  long corridors i dragged my suitcase and backpack there back and forth twice until they were able to get it right she didn t apologize mostly shrugged and said sometimes it s sensitive stands out as bad service 
 when i arrived at  pm the double room i had booked  was not available had been double booked and i was offered a single  with a so called free breakfast even though i knew the breakfast was normally  so they were actually ripping me off eventually they agreed  with a free breakfast the room itself though was incredibly small so much so i had to move the cahir in front of the door to be able to see the to feom the bed
 the building is old and there was a lot of noise from banging doors other residents i guess 
 was impossible to store extracted breastmilk in the freezer due to hotel policy i could use the fridge at reception but i would have booked a different hotel if i knew this beforehand aircon was quite noisy windows were dirty 
 room rather gloomy due to limited light and external low level noise assume to be some kind of extraction units extra milk would have be helpful 
 the rooms were to small and everything crammed in the overall condition of hotel is poor with major decoration work needed bathroom was in poor condition with bath panels falling off the extractor fan did not work there was excessive noise from outside i e the kitchen vents etc so we could not have windows open at night if we had wanted to open them it was only about  which is ridiculous the air conditioning was so loud we could not get a full nights sleep it also seemed to be stuck at one temp even if you adjusted it the tv remote did not work properly so had to use controls on the tv unit itself which meant getting out of bed to turn tv off which at the hotel prices should never be the case we wanted luxury not excercise 
 extract fan outside the window droned on and on all day and all night aggravating tinnitus 
 have stayed here several time in very nice rooms but this time the room was very tired with watermarks on the ceiling from a leak the shower leaked so much that there was no pressure i was moved to an equally tired room across the corridor but at least the shower worked i was obviously in the budget area but not at a budget price 
 the first room a twin room facing the court yard was awful noisy air con and windows could not open unable to sleep but we got another room which was very nice we dont really eat breakfast and it was a little annoying that the reception lept trying to make us book breakfast 
 the room was a bit small and warm as only  window of the  could be opened for only  inches our room was on the side of the hotel and the morning sun makes the room so hot bathroom was a bit disappointing small very tine sink next to bath like u have in your house in a downstairs toilet your elbow touches the wall when brushing teeth or cleaning face shower head is the old fashioned the one attached to the wall so you cant take the head down 
 room didn t face on to russell square but was quite noisy windows did little to cut out minimise noise fellow guests were also quite noisy walls doors were quite thin and noise filtered in 
 size of room
 there wasn t anything to not like
 hotel interior is looking a little tired and could do with a minor make over the rooms are very clean so don t be put off 
 noise in room was awful toilet was stuck to the side of wash hand basin making it difficult to use very small bathroom windows need replacing urgently this will help with noise i was surprised at breakfast to find only mugs on the table no saucers no table covers tea and toast would be nice if brought to table herb sausages at breakfast scrambled eggs need to be kept hotter as with most of the buffet breakfast was lukewarm 
 disabled wet room was not informed about this during check in
 the rooms are not so good the first night i stayed on the th floor the room was unconfortably cold as the roof is not insulated and the windows are very old and draughty only lukewarm water in the shower in the morning the second night i moved to the third floor the room was larger and nicer but again the windows were draughty and single glazed and the sink in the bathroom was ridiculously small 
 window needed to be washed but not much of a view on the backside of the building anyway 
 can not think of anything 
 shower was over the bath and it was high to get into a walk in shower is preferable for me however it didn t spoil our wonderful stay 
 nothing no complaints throughout our stay
 the shower in the bathroom is not detachable and every time had to wet my hair 
 i had a double room at the back of the hotel which was a bit noisey due to air conditioner units the room should of had a fridge and being a double room should of had two of everything in the bathroom which it did not 
 room wasn t available until   hours after check in time bathroom too small we expected a little more from a four star hotel 
 i can t think of anything 
 refreshments in the bedroom were very poor for a hotel of this calibre wallpaper loose on ceiling all rooms should be in excellent condition
 shower went hot and cold and noise from other rooms annoying i know its central london and the traffic noise doesn t bother me but someone throwing up in the next room that sounds like its right by your head is not so good 
 could have done with a hook next to the shower to hang your towel on 
 the room is far away too small than we though and the picture shows the facility is old in the room the sink and drainage hole of bathtub broken and worse we change the room more than one time enduring the rest of our staying 
 despite being on the th floor we couldn t believe how noisy our room was from the traffic in the street below single glazed very old windows that really need replaced though a good wash would be a start bed was not comfy the room was small but clean i think these rooms are for booking com customers you get what you pay for i guess 
 room was small but no complaints given the price that s london unless you pay top dollar 
 the toilet was stinking pretty bad normal rooms were not great and looked different from website had to upgrade to premier to get a nicer room and it wasnt as nice as hoped still 
 the room did not appear to share the classical feel of the hotel it felt far cheaper than the  i paid but the bathroom was excellent 
 can t think of anything really 
 no issues
 the bathroom sink was very close to the toilet therefore lack of room to sit on the toilet properly would be a struggle for a larger person especially a male to sit on in comfort also lack of mirrors light in the room a nice dressing table chair but no big mirror light to get ready in front of 
 hotel is going through a major refund but is definately looking tired
 would have been nice to have a view of russel square from the room but luck of the draw i guess 
 nothing not to like 
 having no lift found the rd floor very hard to climb the stairs as i m restricted because of health problem definitely would go back to this hotel only on a ground floor 
 the breakfast was always the same the room and bathroom very small the fruit juices were not fresh the staff that opened the doors was always grumpy
 the bed that was not so confortabl my room was looking in the inner part of the building and was really noisy outside 
 not convinced that teaspoons were replaced each day as they had a feint residual smell no double glazing so room a bit cold and moisture inside window overnight ridiculous price for breakfast originally  which i declined 
 had room overlooking courtyard which had massive air conditioning units they were really noisy needed earplugs tea and milk was not replenished
 this isn t a dislike but our bathroom was looking abit tired and needed a face lift but having so many rooms i am sure the upgrade will get there we were on tge th floor 
 we had more than a little trouble with a window right next to the bed that we couldn t get closed which caused a very uncomfortable draft in my small room the concierge tried helping and we put in a request for maintenance but it was two windows causing the issue they fixed one the second night but not the other 
 had to change rooms twice once because the bath had a chip in it the mirror had a big crack across it and the alternative room given was tiny for the price paid i feel the up keep of some of the rooms is quite poor given the star rating of the hotel we also had to pay to upgrade to a better room which i don t think was fair given the rooms we were offered originally and the quality of them
 i have used this hotel a few times before and never been disappointed however our room this time  was quite shabby inside compared to previous visits there wasn t even any bottled water also on trying to find the room at  pm after a long day the signage was very misleading and led us to a door which was closed off and unavailable due to construction we then had to get a member of staff to show us the alternative route which we would never have found had we followed the brass signage 
 the shower in my room kept collapsing the wind howled through the window all night such that the air conditioning v noisy kept kicking in to keep the temperature up kept coming on i eventually had to turn it off we had a whisky nightcap in the bar which had bits floating in it the waitress explained it was from the ice we had specifically ordered without ice it took two of us complaining twice to get it changed v poor considering   per glass breakfast v average more like a  star hotel 
 cold room no fridge or mini bar tv was useless and would barely work room was a bit tired 
 sound insulation our room gave on the street and it was really noisy small bed a bit expensive
 i wanted to do a checkout the night before i left due to an early train and i was surprised it wasn t possible the next morning checkout took a little longer than planned and we missed a train to the airport getting us there later than planned but the great thing was reception had kindly printed our boarding cards for us which made up the time 
 i have been staying at the russell several times a year for twenty years though less frequently now i feel that breakfast arrangements are less customer friendly than they used to be paper napkins have replaced fabric there are no saucers for the coffee cups and i had to go hunting for a desert spoon and a teaspoon 
 my room on the th floor had been refurbished but some of the fittings were of poor quality and should have been rejected 
 room small overlooking air con units and the windows were screwed shut had to rely on air con not a comfortable night 
 breakfast was tasty and good value at  but not if we had had to pay full price of  
 its a very old hotel undergoing rehab which made for some noise and dust however the worse part of the hotel was the internet we needed to work and were unable to connect to anything workable its a cool old hotel but if you re going on business and need internet bring your own 
 reception were exceptionally slow at booking in checking out the rooms were very tatty paint flaikinh off the wall the sink was cracked etc lack of vegetarian food available 
 opaque window so had no view
 long waiting time at check in which was not yet peak time noisy difficult getting to sleep and woken up early for the same reason
 we had no cold running water with  days to go we were offered another room which was a bit of an inconvenience to move our things and room was much smaller we were offered breakfast on next  mornings as compensation as it wasn t included in our price so that did make things a lot more acceptable 
 the windows in the bedroom had broken sashes and paint flacking off and odd bodged tiles around the toilet
 windows are made with frosted glass so there is no way to see the view or even to open them no mini fridge in the room there is no information on how to call the reception from the room the sink in the bathroom was blocked and hook for the towels was just laying in the hole detached from the wall photos attached moreover there was very strange sound coming from the street which was annoying and disturbed our sleep water costs  ponds per bottle do not feel like  stars at all 
 the confusion at check in as i d altered the booking from double and a single room refunderble to a twin and single none refunderble they said that i still had the refunderble booked and needed to pay as to late to cancel luckerly i had proof on my phone but they still insisted i contact booking com to check
 we had a broken cold tap in the bathroom which couldn t be repaired that day we booked an alarm call for  am which came late there was no trouser press in the room we had paid extra for an upgrade we
 pillows were lumpy shower drained very slowly so you have to keep stopping it for it to drain breakfast way overpriced at   asked for a nice view but had a horrid one so kept curtains closed 
 would appreciate a  level charge for breakfast i only eat a bowl a cereal matress too soft 
 small beds premier inn is ahead of most hotel chains on this front also cost of a glass of wine at  for a relatively basic malbec was a bit steep but they have to make their money back somewhere 
 the breakfast could have been cheaper ie included in the price we were with a party of  there wasn t any negotiation on the price 
 it was a bit noisy with busy road just outside
 the room was much smaller than the one we had last time 
 despite it being midwinter the temperature of the rooms was very high and the air conditioning made no difference even the alternative room we were offered was just as hot 
 during my last  days the wifi connection became very weak and spotty staff said it was being worked on but i sensed that a fast resolution wasn t high enough priority 
 the windows in our room were unfortunately in need of repair with one rather loose glass pane rattling every so often from the traffic on the streets below traffic is heavy from am so this meant no lie in for me double glazing may help 
 the bathroom is very small so there wasnt enough room to put my toiletries 
 light fittings and bathroom door were dirty cooked breakfast was very greasy and not enough electric sockets available 
 bathroom a bit old and it wasn t cleaned properly room itself was excellent 
 room was clean but in need of some repairs eg broken tiles on bathroom floor and bottom drawers badly worn 
 despite being in the heart of london but the location is very noisy and inconvenient a lot of people move around super noisy and you would never feel piece of mind on top of that single rooms are very small like a grave i would never stay there again 
 location was not very entertaining from tourist point of view i had a room with inside view so felt very suffocated 
 tv is at a height and an angle where you cant watch it when sitting in a chair you either have to sit far away or stand up not to get a distorted view breakfast not being included in the room rate is a big minus for me 
 the mattress bed sheets comforter and pillow not comfy enough aicon a bit noisy 
 the noise level in my room from the ventilation put it this way i woke up  times
 not a dislike but some areas could do with a spring clean its a busy hotel so difficult to close areas off to follow this through however this would not stop me from staying here again
 the noise it was extremely noisy in the morning from am with the sound of sirens going to the nearby hospitals every  minutes in fact the standard twin was small and bathroom tiny 
 ran out of hot food items eg bacon sausages left waiting for breakfast on both days windows don t open in the rooms for security reasons so no fresh air in the room hotel bar prices are quite expensive 
 air conditioning horrendously noisy cutting in with a loud bang every  mins throughout the night very poor sleep as a result 
 the public areas were very grand but our room was a little worn the windows were filthy there were lights missing and the bathroom floor was not entirely clean 
 the window in room  was very old and was a draft coming in from the gaps 
 we were in a family room frosted windows looking at brick wall no natural light and room was very old and cold not enough towels or toiletries for us all
 no bath in the room inside courtyard facing window horrible view windows wouldn t stay open shower door wouldn t close very small television and phone located in bathroom 
 price ok for a business trip though slightly high considering breakfast wasn t included in room price upgraded room could have been nicer 
 some of the staff are not very helpful not professional the facilities are bad e g small left not suitable for people with wheelchair or having many large luggage my room was very small with tiny sink in which the water not moving easily rapidly get full the do not disturb sign was missing 
 nothing not to like at a pn price point
 the only reason i booked with hotel russell was because of the bath advertised to be in my room but when i got there it looked nothing like in the picture it was dirty and had badly chipped enamel there weren t any complementary items worth mentioning just a small amount of cheap shampoo and the room took ages to heat up 
 the chaise lounge in the room needs some attention looks a bit shabby 
 we had  rooms booked and one wasnt ready at check in time we had to wait an hour for it the bathrrom in one of the rooms was tiny
 absolutely nothing
 lifts are little small so at busy times and with suitcases became a challenge more drawer space would ve been helpful and compliment refreshments tray would ve benefitted from bottled water room overlooked all the boiler pipes etc which at times was very loud nice breakfast but over priced for what it was
 we stayed last year and our room was nicer didn t like the view from  the machines heaters or what ever they were noisy however would still stay again 
 the room was drafty but it s an old building and the room was on the corner i expected it and it wasn t much of an issue 
 rooms are too small there is no water or mini bar available at rooms small water is offered within the price almost given every hotel including  stars rooms are too cold and the heating system of the room is not sufficient to heat the room 
 no notice given fire alarm tested no staff on floors to say there was not a fire rooms not cleaned until very late in the day
 the bathroom is very small
 the frosted windows limited light to some extent but then again views in london can be rather poor 
 i was initially given a room which had no wifi and without heating room was freezing cold i was offered to t have a electric heater to warm up the room the room was changed but the one which was changed was much smaller and was noisy the wash basin had non functional tap luckily i had one night stay booked only won t like to stay in this hotel ever again not recommended 
 maid didn t make the room two days
 very very poor sleep during stay 
 odd that a posh hotel was pushing adult channels in the rooms don t people have the internet the dinning room was great but the plastic tables and supermarket breakfast was a let down staff were not the same standard as the hotel the bar was dirty and always had to get up to ask for things despite there being  people behind the bar chatting to each other all in all a great hotel but not well run 
 we felt that the bathroom was missing several items that you would expect to find in such a hotel i e toilet brush shower cap cotton wool face cloths the room had a very narrow window looking out over a boiler or something similar this was supposed to be a superior room but that was hard to believe 
 windows need cleaning shower slow to drain and sink faucet leaks need fixing the only real complaint is that the doors of other rooms closing along with the fire doors at night are fairly noisy and could keep a light sleeper up 
 the air conditioning in are room didn t work so well so it got really warm didn t feel the need to complain as we loved staying a spa would of been nice in the hotel also
 the hotel ventilation units were just outside the window working   you can not imagine the noise check the photos no refrigerator room was rather small
 this property is listed as accessible my daughter uses a manual wheelchair but is able to stand for very short periods this facility is only accessible if they set up a motorized device much like a stairway system installed in one s home can you imagine the trouble it would be to have that device set up each time you came and went the embarrassment and time wasted cannot be estimated i ended up carrying my daughter s chair there was not always a doorman present up the   steps while my daughter hauled herself up and down using the railing this facility is not accessible unless you come and go once a day with scheduled times in fact when we first arrived a bellman told us there was not a way to get into the hotel w a wheelchair the staff requires education later that evening the manager called and apologized for staff being unaware of the electric system please change your listing to not accessible the table floor lamp was tipsy when we wrote on the surface it would almost tip over the bathroom appeared clean but the shower curtain smelled mildewed 
 tiny room for  while listening to people stamping around above and paper walls next door had enter and leave the room very awkwardly just to get in and out due to no space ridiculous price and nothing like what is shown in the pictures on booking beware 
 lack of toilet facilities on the ground floor opposite end of the hotel to the restaurant and bar which when you have mobility issues can be a long trek 
 the hotel was undergoing a refurbishment and needs it in a lot of areas we were offered a choice of rooms including a quiet room this turned out to be a pokey double bedroom at the front of the hotel facing onto the square with single glazed windows noisy all night bath did not drain and bathroom was pokey small was changed to a better room on second night which was much better but beware of hit and miss and make sure to ask for a quality room 
 i generally do not eat breakfast in the hotel partly because carluccio s is close at hand and i am more interested in italian cuisine than a more conservative english hotel cuisine i hesitate to say that i am unhappy with the dining room or the bar because the hotel is so wonderful in other respects nevertheless these might be the only parts of the russell that would benefit from change that being said however few hotels manage change successfully and i would hate to see the russell lose its undoubted charm 
 the bed was itself very uncomfortable and very noisy which really spoil tour trip the pillows were well used and lumpy the breakfast was not the best coffee and tea were not great tasting some breakfast items were luke warm and queuing up to make toast 
 found the room far to hot comparable to when i slept in egypt but that s probably personal to me would of liked a room with a view but what do you expect when paying less than normal price and you are only sleeping 
 bedroom was small but to be expected staying in a double room in london if you wanted something spacious maybe upgrade to a delux we didn t and regretted it but overall enjoyable hotel would defiantly return
 the room we had was v small for the amount we paid  for one night you could only just walk around the bed and there was hardly any space to store clothes
 no mini bar in the room and the temperature controls didn t function properly small tv screen 
 our room was very substandard for a deluxe double with cracks on the bathroom floor a leaking sing no mirror with the vanity table the bed was not completed with cushions and throws and the overall ambiance of the room was awful 
 staff not as professional as i remember layout of the reception entrance hall does not reflect the grandeur of the hotel 
 i had to wait over  minutes for a bar meal 
 no double glazing on our windows so traffic noise awful from am no conditioner in the bathroom no shower caps breakfast food was pretty ordinary seems like it s now aiming at the imperial hotels market which is frankly down market used to do better 
 room was tired looking very small and windows had so much condensation damp i had to use a towel to dry it off not good for my asthma
 i didn t like the breakfast for the price it cost i ve stayed at other  star hotels with much more variety the bed creaked and in order to open the door with the card i had to make several attempts 
 we have stayed here many times and will again but we were this time under a very creaky floor room  so were disturbed by noise several times which has never happened before will maybe avoid this room next time 
 the lifts are very small breakfast has no fresh salad such as sliced tomatoes cucumbers i would also add some more selection of cheese and sausages
 the first room they gave us smelt of cigarettes then we were put in a tiny room sink was blocked shower didn t work properly also the television didn t work very well 
 would have expected a touch more luxury in the rooms for the price shower hard to control and poor flow mouldy silicone sealant cracked tiles not really worth the extra money back to premier inn in future 
 the room we were offered standard double was nothing like that advertised paid for superior double no bath no view in fact no window i can only describe the room as a converted broom cupboard i am very dissapoibted with both the hotel and your booking system which is extremely misleading at least when marketing this hotel 
 breakfast was too expensive so went elsewhere could hear a low generator humming throughout the night
 bathroom facilities very small and cramped not really suitable for my pregnant wife so larger people would have been very uncomfortable room a little dated and check in was slow due to roads being closed around bloomsbury square car park the hotels suggestion and discounted offer the car park was only accessible by one road which neither the hotel staff or police could direct to  mins later we found it was only a short walk so could be better on other days 
 the bathroom was that small you couldn t reach the sink unless you were stood sideways if the radiator had been on it would have been very uncomfortable
 i have never seen a worse bed in any hotel i ve stayed in anywhere in the world was well past its best and staff knew it as they instantly refunded my payment 
 tray of used crockery etc outside my door when checking in to my room still there several hours later thermostat limited on very cold night not warm enough 
 however the rooms were not maintaned so well as the common parts of the hotel tv handler did not work wifi did not work phone in the room did not work concierge was nice and came into my room to repair but definetly rooms are overpriced they are old and need a strong refurbishment 
 the buffet breakfast was the single worst hot buffet i ve ever had plates were dirty with dried on food and when told about this the guy behind the buffet just gave me another plate also dirty with no apology sausages only cooked on one side congealed beans hash browns literally dripping grease such a shame as the dining room could be an asset to an otherwise decent and historic hotel 
 decor is extremely tired and dated wallpaper peeling off walls windows did not open mould around window edges and in shower grouting antiquated bathroom and a standalone heater in the bedroom dust around edges of carpet i m not sure how this is acceptable in a central london hotel which costs upwards of  per night definitely will not be recommending this hotel to friends or re visiting myself although i can t praise the staff enough 
 there was nothing that we didn t like 
 had a bad experience with room service  minutes we waited until we called to chase up then we were told it would be another  minutes clearly they didn t make note of our order from our first call we also paid for late check out until pm but were disturbed  times by housekeeping obvious lack of communication 
 bathroom could be more taken care of windows were old and a little worn off there could be possibility to go to the balcony
 personal not amiable the room did not match the pictures on the website the ac in my room was really noisy and it took me  visits to the reception for them to change my room 
 bring earplugs lots of traffic noise but no problem with earplugs in 
 bar and lounge area were very dark so made it difficult to read books or magazines or any literature that we wanted to review for a next days adventures
 the breakfast experience is like something out of bhs they need to make it a little more like an quality hotel experience also the bar is a disaster they don t know whether they are running a pub type facility ie bar service or a lounge facility ie waiter service i won t go in again 
 nothing 
 my room wasn t very clean dirt chunks coming out of heater onto desk when i mentioned that at front desk they just smiled at me white spots on extra blanket so i didn t want to use it although i love the location and this is my nd stay it will probably be my last 
 there was a large cobweb in the corner above the tv room  the bar area was difficult to find a seat so i had to resort to staying in my room when i just needed to sit down rest and have a well deserved beer 
 had to wait for a second room as first one did not offer a bath as requested freezing room until radiators kicked in tired carpet poor insulated windows
 auto service charge paying extra for breakfast good food but no better than other uk   star i ve stayed in no soundproofing 
 the bar prices are astronomically high so we left the hotel and spent the evenings elsewhere 
 we booked a superior then upgraded to a junior suite we found a mouse in the room and it was handled terribly they moved us to a smaller room with a bad view and it was  single beds pushed together they gave us the  it cost to upgrade back and offered us complimentary breakfast but after seeing a mouse in our room there was no way we were going to eat there they then offered champagne which when it came to the room was not champagne at all it was sparkling wine for the amount we paid to find a mouse in the room and for the staff to not even care it s fair to say we will never be staying there again 
 my room had the old style windows and so the draft and noise from the main road was slightly inconvenient but did not detract from my experience 
 not very clean and rooms not really looked after lots of little things were very worn dirty or broken in the bathroom and room 
 breakfast pricing of  for  ppl was not included in our stay deal seemed a tad disproportionate and unfair but perhaps london thinks it can justify that price for egg bacon a sausage toast and tea we had breakfast at giraffe cafe  minutes away very nice 
 we got a room that was very small and not very fresh the pictures on the hotels website for std dbl room was not what we got we could change room though 
 we had booked a superior double room but were given a twin with sofa bed when we asked about this we were told there were no double rooms we could have but to compensate were given free breakfast our room was on the second floor and the night we stayed there was a wedding reception in the ground floor reception room directly below us which meant putting up with loud music well after midnight i was surprised not to have a mini bar in the room and there were no hangers to hang long articles of clothing presumably the height of the hanging rail was intended for wheel chair users i also found i kept banging my elbow on the handrail in the shower over the bath again an adaptation for disabled guests the shower head could not be angled to anything other than straight down which meant standing awkwardly so as not to get my hair wet no shower cap provided and it also did not stay at the height i required and needed constant raising we went for breakfast at probably the most popular time and had to wait for a table even though there were tables for two empty and next to each other which could have been pushed together to accommodate the three of us couples were taken from the queue behind us and seated whilst we had to wait for a larger table to empty when a table of six left theirs was seperated to make a four and a two so why couldn t two tables be pushed together for us earlier 
 staff at the reception didn t give us  sets of cards the lights went in one of the rooms and no one told me that my son was moved to another room 
 no leisure gym facilities 
 the decor while nice is a little tired e g fabric on chair is torn woodwork chipped this was only a small point but is a bit out of step with the grand exterior and reception area of the hotel 
 some noise at times if staying on the front of the hotel from road noise but the windows and curtains muffle that overnight 
 only a few things the blind in the bathroom covered with dirty fingerprints and the one in the bedroom coming away from windowframe also couldn t get the shower to work but that may just have been me 
 our bedroom was very small that together with our very small bathroom and the continual annoyance that the water in the bath was very very very slow exit added to our chagrin i did mention to reception staff the problem we encountered with our bath however nothing transpired to resolve this matter 
 bar staff did not know that a egg benedict had bacon in it no wake up alarm despite the fact that they asked if i wanted it 
 breakfast seemed chaotic the first morning we went to the buffet to get our cooked breakfast when we returned to the table it had been completely cleared the very disinterested supervisor apologised but did nothing in the end we had to go to another table to get cutlery and cups breakfast was now cold coffee did eventually arrive i like hot milk with my coffee which wasn t a problem but in the second morning the hot milk arrived but was quite clearly off it took some minutes for anyone to come close to the table and even longer to get a replacement cup and milk the cup had a huge chip in the rim so yet again we had to wait
 nothing
 unwanted alarm call at  am rather spoiled my day but got our breakfasts free to compensate so pleased with that breakfast room needs refurbishment to make more of the titanic connection 
 pillows hard shower tray didnt drain had to time shower outside patio door didnt fit draughts to room
 the room which we were in was a standard one needs a revamp there was black mild on bathroom tiles if any older persons were stopping in that room it s very difficult to get into the bath 
 the food choice in the restaurant is not very pronounced and exciting more fresh fruit at breakfast
 during our stay there was a problem with the toilet not clearing however this was fixed fairly quickly and another room given to use that toilet whilst we were inconvenienced so a minus and a plus here we had a meal arranged for christmas lunch and my wife who is partially disabled had to flag down a taxi for herself directly outside the hotel even though there was concierge staff on duty nearby i was angry at the lack of helpfulness 
 room was small and very basic for price but bed very comfortable view was onto a wall would be nice to have a mini bar fridge and water plus additional wall sockets we had to unplug tv to charge phone i pad
 the beds vere hard and unplesant the rooms old and need a renovation the staff in the bar did not know what a frozen cosmopolitan was and they did not give u time to look at the bar meny they wanted to take ur order the minutt you sat foot in the bar not good at all the hotel was to expensive all in all 
 that s the beds were not secured and if you sat up in bed to watch tv or read the bed moved forward away from wall the bathroom was a bit cramped around the toilet due to the large sink there was a smell coming from the sink when you used it i think its needs some bleach we did not eat breakfast at the hotel due to the price of   each for  nights would be nearly   we ate out instead 
 nothing staff were not helpful and infact rude it was not what we were expecting it looked dated and nothing like the pictures we then decides to stay at the may fair hotel instead and got a refund won t be going there again that s for sure
 expensive breakfast went to pret some fittings not right bathroom door did not shut plug in sink didn t forgivable because its such an iconic building but certainly not competition to the best in the west end 
 the bar was closed when we returned at  o clock on new years eve they wouldnt even bring us a drink to the room 
 old hotel with small rooms for  stars construction work right outside my window could not sleep did not effect price rather stay in a modern hotel with upgraded facilities 
 room was smaller than cheaper hotel next door less facilities i e tea coffee selection music from wedding booming until   pm though they did pay for two breakfasts to compensate 
 the tv didn t work in the standard rooms it s very dated very basic and not what i d expect from a star hotel premier inn would have been better shower had mould sort of inside the sealant really noisey this place needs the double glazing looking at
 the quality of the mattress of the bed was really bad for the money i paid i expected at least a decent mattress 
 far from the attractions and russell square tube is pointless
 the hair dryer was attached to a unit that was positioned approximately  feet away from the dressing table this is too far away when trying to style your hair fortunately i had taken my own hair dryer the lighting in the room was too low it would have been helpful to have had a bright light positioned by the dressing table to make drying of hair and putting on of make up that much easier 
 missed breakfast one day as insufficient capacity in the restaurant and the wait would have been too long as i had to go to a meeting
 wifi didnt work in the room staff weren t as polite as you would expect for the price despite changing the key numerous times none of them worked well for the door cant control water temperature no free water daily restaurant food disappointing all in all we cant recommend this hotel 
 trainee receptionist at front desk was rude and abrupt very poor and mean selection of tea coffee etc in hotel room and the same for shampoo moisturising etc samples in bathroom 
 i ordered a sandwich from the limited room service available after pm but was very disappointed that the beef slices had an inch of thick fat on each this was extremely poor quality 
 the dining room was too full and very noisy we did not like having to queue for a table the tap in the bathroom leaked 
 i feel that the bathroom showers baths could be improved and made more user friendly having to clamber into the bath to have your shower should be a thing of the past
 the staff could have been a little more helpful with our luggage they didn t seem to realise that helping us from the door to the lifts would have been a huge help however the staff were very friendly which made up for that 
 although the staff were nice they screwed our meal orders up twice our room was really nice the first night large room with a window we decided to come back and stay a second night but got put in a terrible room very small the air conditioning didn t work so we had to open all the windows in the middle of winter to keep it cool there was a bank of about  air conditioning units right outside our window so it was super noisy the bathroom stunk of mold and lynx deodorant the drains were blocked and the bed was terrible it was super hard and super creaky which woke us up a lot in the night between the creaky bed and the air conditioning units outside the stuffy heat and the mouldy stench we didn t have a very good sleep at all i think maybe we stayed in an upgraded room the first night without knowing an upgrade was offered to us the second night for  pounds but we didn t think we needed it and assumed we d have a similar room as the previous night but we definitely didnt on a different topic the adult movie channel was terrible super fetishy chin strap ons surgical instruments lots of pvc and horrible badly lit ugly people having gross sex not my cup tea but if you re into that kind of stuff you ll love this place 
 the main light in the bedroom didn t work and although maintenance came quickly it was never replaced meaning the room was quite dark we also thought we would have a safety deposit box in our room which turned out not to be there 
 the exterior of the building is magnificent but the interior has seen better days and in need of a refurb at the end of the day the rooms are compact clean and comfortable just don t plan on spending too much time in them which you shouldn t be get outside and see some stuff or go hang in a pub 
 shower 
 breakfast on sunday morning was a disaster arriving half an hour before service was due to close we found a queue to get a table with many many tables waiting to be cleared there was no hot food left and a real shortage of staff hot food did not finally all come through until an hour after we arrived at the restaurant staff were great throughout 
 some staff not helpful few problems with the room leaky shower door bed on castors with brakes that didn t work a rattling window and a loose connection on tv
 the positives seem to end with the building the staff were pretty rude and dismissive particularly in the bar where it seemed like it was all too much effort to bring the food or take a drinks order the room was freezing and the hot water broke for a period of time the breakfast was in a nice room but again it was freezing and most people seemed to have their coats on 
 disappointed that our upgrade did not live up to expectations of pictures on the invitation email which i suspect were from a different hotel altogether this was misleading the suite was very noisy with traffic on the road outside and noise from the stair well just outside the door i felt this was poor value for the additional money spent 
 room key was older strip type which failed to work even the replacement was temperamental which was a bit of an inconvenience with me being located on the th floor 
 very poor water pressure in sink and had to run tap for several minutes before vaguely warm toulet did not flush properly very difficult to climb into bath and shower was one of those you have to stand in the water flow to adjust risking scalding or freezing shower was freezing in morning with no hot water for  mins had to give up furnishings a little tired 
 one staff member on check in was obviously having a bad day the other staff however were very helpful 
 room was very warm 
 staff unpleasant walking past lots of smokers every time you returned to the hotel view of sky dishes toiletries water etc not replenished furniture in room marked dirty 
 the heating in the restaurant was not working with the air conditioning locked in the on position not possible to enjoy eating there in the evening original room allocated was not as requested small and with one small double bed not able to move room until the next day and then only at an additional charge very small bar area with nowhere else to sit with friends 
 upgrade at  per night which had been previously at  online view across park from  obscured by grime on external window but not a big issue though was area son for taking upgrade
 no adverse experiences whatsoever 
 booked and paid for this booking for a colleague she doubled checked all was paid on check in was told all okay then was made to pay a supplement on checkout have since emailed looking for the gms name so i could get their feedback on my colleagues experience to date haven t heard back from them as a company we will not use hotel again 
 the two night stay was a little pricey for a relatively small room and with no breakfast included although the room was clean quiet and comfortable 
 there was a wedding on which made it a little noisy when sleeping despite asking for a room at the back so it was quiet 
 room  dirty filthy windows with some double glazed panels missing from the frames cracked floor tiles in bathroom dirty basin old creased badly fitted carpet and dirty greasy finger marks above the bed bulbs out tv not working not what i would expect for  star
 single room was rather noisy due to hvac system duct outside and poor quality single pane windows offering little insulation non smoking room requested but hall had a hint of tobacco 
 the continual noise from the air conditioning heating fans outside and the loud beats of music from a party evening both making it difficult to get to sleep 
 pillows were too soft without an option in the room lifts were a bit of a problem on our final day
 could not find our booking on arrival eventually found not listed under my surname chaos leaving luggage as early check in was not actioned lots of fire doors to get through with luggage to room key card to door faulty and had to be reprogrammed 
 non working central heating draught noise of traffic coming in from the windows considering we paid for an upgrade some aspects were very ordinary i e only  earl grey tea bag decoration of room very dated 
 claustrofobic size of a room the fact that every time i wanted to use wi fi i needed to logg in extremely annoying the very thin duvet and lack of a spare blanket no signal on tv
 as lead organiser of our group i was rather dissapointed when being given a small room at the back of the hotel on the th floor 
 shabby room
 junior suite cold and uncomfortable room no bath and the shower screen was cracked and a possible health hazard could not keep the room warm a very second rate experience the management paid for our replacement room in the holiday inn
 the noise an event was in in the hotel and the music was loud not what i would expect for such a hotel the manager on duty that night was rude and un helpful the bed was uncomfortable and broken the hotel itself is beautiful such a shame the night for us was ruined by loud music and an unhelpful night manager we received a full refund for out night stay 
 we had one incidence of noise from fellow residents but phoned reception and they sorted it out very quickly
 nothing 
 paid to upgrade to a suite had to ask for a dressing gown room very shabby no sleep because of traffic noise throughout the night told reception on check out no discount offered 
 the steps at the front entrance made it difficult for my girlfriend who uses a wheelchair however the door staff were  wonderful and made it as easy as possible i understand that it s a listed building and not something that can be changed 
 dirty bathroom door torn carpet wardrobe door did not close missing reading light at bed leaving a hole dirty bathroom blind left letter of complaint have not had a response  hours later
 house keeping came knocking on our bedroom door at am sunday morning before i woke up realised what was happening she was letting herself into the room i did get an apology from reception staff it wouldn t put me off staying there though 
 the hotel rooms and corridors are very run down in desperate need of renovation the bed was pushed into the corner meaning one person had to climb over the bed the furniture was damaged and the blind was hanging off of the window not what i expect from a  star hotel was very disappointed 
 the windows of the room we stayed in were badly insulated there was a draft but as we didn t stay in the room much during daytime it was ok 
 unacceptable level of customer service once we arrived we paid for an upgrade for a more spacious room with a view the room was indeed lovely yet the temperature in the room was extremely low it was freezing cold they send us an engineer to fix the air conditioning system we spent approximately  hours calling at the reception and waiting for the engineer to finish his work waiting for the air conditioning system to be fixed at some point we had to leave the room because we had scheduled business appointments the hotel personnel reassured us that by the time we would be back everything would be fine at  pm when we returned to the room we faced the same condition a freezing cold room we spent one hour fighting with the duty manager and the hotel personel till they brought us  portable heaters in the room and we eventually managed to heat the room with those heaters the air conditioning system never worked as the hotel personnel kept insisting 
 the side facing the road is a bit noisy the position of the tv in my room is a bit odd the angle is wrong for sitting down 
 i booked one double room for myself and my husband and a twin room for my daughters the girls room was lovely and spacious giving them great comfort whereas ours was rather cramped with a small bathroom and not much space to get in and out of the door once our suitcase was on the case stand i also felt the wardrobes were not deep enough to fit suites in without the doors staying open this was even more restricted by the ironing board being located in the wardrobe too 
 double room size is not as the pictures lighting in the room is noisy no fridge water in bathroom switches hot to cold suddenly room is cold so i had to open air conditioning to heat
 the room was very cramped hot very noisy the en suite was tiny and had a cracked basin dripping shower we pointed this out to staff but didn t appear interested breakfast was very basic i spend a lot of time in hotels feel this was not even a budget hotel standard 
 it will be nice when the furniture up grades are completed
 boiler broke so no hot water the shower temperature control the heating and the towel rail didn t work the bathroom was tiny 
 shower very poor water pressure low water temp control non existent
 very noisy motors all night presumably from air condition outlets shower difficult to control as hot tap was broken but not discovered until the morning when needing to get out for a meeting so no time to ask for it to be fixed bar area insufficient for the size of hotel had hoped for a quiet drink before departure but bar overflowing with guests about to attend a function 
 room was very small for cost and view from window was shocking a brick wall as a result the room was very dark not enough tea coffee and sugar for cost of room 
 room was shabby broken shower parts tv small and grainy and limited options
 thought the room was compact and bijou bathroom was situated right next to one of the beds fell out of bed into the bathroom lovely view of a brick wall and generators for the room and view thought it was overpriced 
 heating wasn t working which took two visits from the technicians to sort out in the space of four and a half hours 
 cold dining room at breakfast croissants etc should have been warm 
 booked a superior room for two and had the confirmation for that at arrival they told us the room was not available and offered two single rooms instead we declined so we got what they call standard double the room was minuscule had no heating at all the window that went on an inner courtyard was completely condensed after half an hour we tried to warm up the room with the hairdryer in addition to that the curtain didn t go up at all the overall experience was absolute sub standard in compensation they offered after some discussion a complementary breakfast and a  discount i wouldn t come back here anyway and i wouldn t recommend this hotel to anybody from the outside it s really beautiful once passed the doors it s another story 
  as usually most of hotels in eur have small rooms  they didn t have fridge  a little be it expensive
 our junior suite was exceptionally tired a challenging room very noisy and cold not at all restful in any way wires hanging under the tv poor standard of decoration especially in the bathroom taps in bath overbath shower very stiff and difficult to regulate no water or hot water on the final day dirty walls in bathroom poor recognition of problems by staff zero response mouldy bread in toast bin at breakfast 
 no hot water in the morning as the boilers broke which meant we couldn t get a shower bath before leaving the kettle leaked from the glass indicator so we was unable to use that too for  i expected a lot more 
 the facilities were quite basic so i felt it was quite expensive for what it was the view from our room was very disappointing and it took a long time to speak to anybody in reception 
 no bad experience the tempus bar needs some refurbishment especially the carpet and the fire place needs to be cheerier especially near xmas its a bit dull and dismal overall ulster carpets recently refurbished the castletroy park hotel in limerick ireland they supplied the first carpets which lasted  years and the new carpets which transformed the hotel ditch that dirty burgundy carpet asap 
 no hot water for a few hours on a sunday at am not exactly what you want when wanting a shower no alternative facilities offered bar closed at am
 the breakfast was a bit pricy compared to quality the rooms bathroom was cold and the hotel resturant was not good compared to the quality of the rest of hotel 
 the rooms are variable in size and ours was a little small but very comfortable and clean others in our party had bigger rooms 
 need to pay  pound for  hour late check out even though having notified hotel in advance other hotels we stayed do not need to pay  pound for  hour late check out they are free for  hour late check out 
 i booked the champagne shopping package i expected champagne not just a sparkling wine this was my only disappointment 
 our double room was dated only view was of a collection of air con units the tiniest bathroom ever to run a bath one had to get in to do so poor shower once you could get it going basin area so small was difficult to wash face and teeth disgusting dirty grouting between basin and shower screen breakfast area congested and two mornings in a row had to ask for bread totally underwhelmed by this place 
 i couldn t connect wifi using room number and my registered email i called reception but didn t help finally i was provided an access code at the front desk better to simplfy the wifi access 
 took up an offer to upgrade to a deluxe suite which was very poor
 i booked a room for myself and  sisters it was a superior room with  double beds but it was only set up for  people so we had to ask for everything extra i e towels tea and coffee toiletries which was a bit annoying we booked well in advance so it wasn t like they didn t know we were arriving that was the only downside of our stay as the hotel is lovely and it wouldn t put us of staying again
 very over priced stated as a four star and in my opinion not even close room floor squeaked every where was annoying unless you made it a game to try and walk from bed to bath without squeaking not possible room given was not the room pictured in the ad when i reserved as junior suite not even close although i was told on site it was one of the best buyer beware shower bath access was difficult and i am very agile the tub rim to step over was to my knee caps and i am   so if you are short good luck 
 the single room is small but i was more bothered by the noise from the hallway the walls are very thin also there was a little mold on the shower wall on my first night it was removed after i called the front desk about it the next morning otherwise the bathroom was nice 
 wish i had been given the potted history booklet on registration as i would have had more of an explore 
 our room was one of the top twin room paid  a night but no slippers no bath gowns no face cloth very poor toiletries bath tub handle was not clean and rusty water has been dripping and bath room was very cold room has a one very cheap small table which wobble so badly with two armchairs not impressed at all 
 first had a room in the loft which was extrememly warm and some kind of machine noise outside if we opened the window not a good night s sleep very expensive breakfast
 the location and rooms were lovely therefore it was a shame to be disappointed with the check in process taking at least an hour and with a long queue forming behind on check out the long process was repeated along with forgetting to remove an amount from our credit card for sundries although saying they would do so
 the receptionist advised us that our room had a nice view of the park however on getting to our room you had to stand on the bed look out of the very small window to see the park 
 only comment was there was no milk provided on our third day in our room 
 nothing
 returned  to get ready for an early evening concert to find room not cleaned etc no real apology from desk staff not told what was happening no complaint form available when requested a cup of tea while we waited would have been a nice gesture during our wait heard other guests complaining about the same situation and they were in a suite not a four star experience whilst the room was spacious the bathroom left a lot to be desired access to a small sink was in a gap about  inches wide down the side of the bath with a shower screen further reduced by a heated towel rail that projected approx   inches on the wall side the choice was between bump or burn 
 i was disappointed with both of the rooms i booked and not sure if i would book again because of this they looked very tiered and in desperate need of a revamp the photos online are misleading of the bedroom and the bathroom was also poor also there was a leak on the stares and had buckets out catching water 
 the breakfast was ok but i would except much more from  stars hotel the business point needs update the printer wasn t working the chairs were so bed i was worried i will fall down only irish newspaper 
 twin room bathroom was ridiculously tiny a real squeeze to get to the tiny basin good job the heated towel rail wasn t on 
 the air conditioning was difficult to control but this may have been down to the unusually mild weekend we enjoyed
 rooms could do with a bit updating but that is my personnel opinion 
 the supposedly double bed room was too narrow and the room was closer to a single than to a double bed room the tv too small no mini bar even the towels were for one person plus the inside view was awful and there was a continuous noise from the power installations but after my complaints they transferred me to one much better 
 our room was very hot couldn t keep the window open because of the noise the room backed on to the courtyard with all the generators hammering away the air con unit didn t do much continental breakfast was average 
 staff in the morning on arrival friendly and helpful staff at night appeared to be unhappy in their job and with each other 
 bar area small for a big hotel we wanted to take a coffee in there one afternoon but all the seats where taken but only around  people in there
 i was in one of the inner rooms and experienced one of the worst nights sleep i have ever had at a hotel due to the noise of the generators all night 
 beds very uncomfortable room very hot we did not have a window that you could see through
 the breakfast was adequate but not fantastic it s probably a good idea to get down early for the breakfast 
 breakfast was almost  extra per person so we didn t have breakfast 
 if i had to complain id say that a bit of noise comes off the corridor i m not sure if it s the thickness of the walls or the acoustical rating on the door 
 lack of double glazing meant it was a bit noisy but it is london 
 the rooms could do with a bit of refurbishment but that s being quite picky 
 the hotel room was filthy and infested with bugs had to be moved into another room which wasn t very nice either 
 looked like a room from the s dim and dismal decor old utility furniture filthy windows looked out onto a service shaft extremely poor value for mopney i stay every few weeks in london usually closer to west end either charing cross or horseguards all are about the same price and infinitely nicer places to stay tv was tiny and no remote housekeeping brought us a spare 
 tv was a little hard to understand but that s being picky
 some small details disturbing the last day the room was not completely clean the small cookie miete on the nightstand 
 nothing at all to complain about 
 the bedding and bathroom were immaculate however the wooden sash windows were loose fitting and rattled so we wedged with tissues they were also really filthy on the outside masking the magnificent london skyline view from the sixth floor the kettle also had a significant leak when filled for  cups 
 tired d cor loud air conditioning unit outside room whitewashed windows so we could not see outside this was a bit oppressive 
 rather expensive with small room and no breakfast included we have stayed nearby in similar rated hotels with better facilities and with breakfast included 
 the curtains didn t quite cover the window so despite the blackout blind i was awake as soon as it got light
 breakfast did not meet the price little variaty in food room windows were out towards a shaft were the ventilation was very noisy all night saturday night we had the pleasure of listening to the loud music from a nearby or in the house disco 
 tried to contact room service but the phone rang for  minutes as the reception was busy all the numbers go through  including emergency and first aid requests there should be separate numbers for differing functions or more staff answering the phone 
 paint is pilling in our room ceiling constant noise of slamming doors due to the aggressive automatic door closer 
 was shown a very small room when i arrived i felt it was too claustrophobic so i upgraded but for the price i paid it wasn t good plus i had to pay extra for breakfast 
 overpriced bad nights sleep due to noise from the street and a strange squeaking noise which carried on day and night 
 we had a tiny room not comfortable at all the room would perhaps suit a single but not a double occupancy and should not be sold as such 
 could not get bb bb and itv on television in room had to go to reception  times before it was sorted 
 our children  and  shared a twin room on the same floor but their tea and coffee supply was not replenished 
 i stayed there  nights and these guys charged me  punds on my credit card as security deposit during the check in plus it has been  days after check out but  pouns has not been put back how great to know i almost have no limit on my credit card
 the room was extremely small and as were staying for  nights was extremely cramped i had requested an upper floor room but was given a room on the first floor which i do nor class as an upper floor our room was at the back of the hotel directly opposite a pub it was extremely noisy until the early hours and then the noise began again prior to am when they were obviously taking the empty bottle out 
 the room was quite dark and had too few electrical outlets if i needed to plug in my laptop i had to unplug the lamp as there was only one outlet near the desk that made the room even darker in  a guest expects better also your website says that the checkout time is   whereas according to the guest directory in the room it s   this inconsistency should be corrected 
 there s a lot more that could be done unemptied bins ashtrays basic amenities single bedrooms are very small i was expecting small but still surprised 
 my error in believing my reservation included one more night but the hr handled this with grace despite my embarrassment 
 i had to print important information and was told the there were internet printing facilities yet the printer continued to give me an error message and i was unsuccessful in printing the documents i also didn t like that i was unable to go out on the balcony 
 traffic noise as windows not double glazed some stains on upholstery windows in junior suite were dirty junior suite was a bit shabby drinks were expensive
 th floor bedrooms
 the air conditioning in the room was broken the room was very warm during the night and we were unable to put the system on is it was making a banging noise 
 first room had an awful bathroom with tired and shabby decor including peeling paint on walls bedroom was cold and basic on request was moved to much better room with great bathroom and a slightly better bedroom not sure how there can be such a jump in standard for the same price 
 there was no halaal breakfast all meat was pork poor show this needs to be looked beef lamb or chicken should be availible in a major city like london
 hot water tap on bath shower did not work when i complained upon booking out i was told there was nothing that could be done i was only staying there to have a nights rest sleep whilst my daughter was critically ill at gosh very disappointed 
 tiny room uncomfortable bedding pillows could have done with being replaced you could hear everything from the corridor and people stumbling into the adjoining rooms 
 room was clean but the pillows and quilt were very old and need replacing the heater didnt work nor did the television the towel rail was cold and no way to turn it on 
 the room was freezing on arrival touch ages to work the system out and at least an hour to warm up the room the shower was cranky and quite old took forever to wash my hair overall decent hotel but the price reflects the location not the hotel i wouldn t pay that amount anywhere else for the type of hotel but it is expected i suppose in central london 
 the room was spacious but chilly and the traffic noise from outside prevented us from having a good nights sleep there were two very large windows in the room both single glazed so outside noise was easily heard in the room 
 there wasn t anything we didn t like and would stay at the hotel russell again 
 not exactly a bad experience but i was disappointed with the quality of facial and toilet tissues provided really cheap and nasty i expect more from a hotel of this rating 
 not having a bath suite 
 the air con was rather noisy so we couldn t really use it even though the room was rather warm 
 the single room was very small and completely misrepresented in booking com it was really claustrophobic and tiny i could not upgrade and there was no fridge the worse that happened to me was when had to stay another night and checked online that they had available room and when i went to the front office to ask if i should book online or direct he informed me that the hotel was fully booked and if i booked online he would honour it but he would rush before me to close the bookings worse hotel experience ever
 let down by lack of attention to detail bedroom was cramped and lacked sufficient storage space if we had been staying more than one night we would not have had enough room to hang store clothes bathroom had no soap holder so soap was left in a puddle on sink no additional bar of soap for shower
 dinner which i told the head of drinks and catering was an absolute disgrace we didn t eat there again 
 the standard room was very small so upgraded which cost another  pound even though i d received an email saying it would visit  pound the stay turned out to be very expensive i ve paid at  less to stay in a better hotel
 couldn t open any windows they were screwed shut couldn t see out of any windows as a film had been put over them not happy about this at all felt shut off from the world and had to go downstairs to the main door to see what the weather was like it was also stifling hot in the morning because of this walls seemed very thin and could hear every little noise in the corridors when trying to sleep 
 bed was very small uncomfortable and noisy quite important when you re paying to sleep room was small and loud due to the generators outside the window it was hot but you couldn t have the window open due to the noise air con sounded like an aeroplane was landing so couldn t have that on either 
 we were originally allocated a double room on the fifth floor which certainly left a lot to be desired the window was filthy and all the knobs on the furniture were either broken or loose not worth   we were moved to the first floor purely because we requested a safety deposit box 
 some signs of wear and tear cleanliness could be a bit better 
 the price did not include breakfast it was not expensive and we paid extra for it but it would have been far better if it had been included 
 the bed of the single room is so short that i would not fit in it and i am cm not exceptionally tall it should be clearly written about the small bed 
 hotel staff didn t appear to have a good command or understanding of english the receptionist argued that my debit credit card could not be used as a credit card when in fact it had been used as a credit card at hotel russell just a week prior when we first arrived in london for the first half of our stay had to request management to sort this out her attitude was non too friendly during this experience as mentioned before we stayed here during the first half our trip as well the movie which cost a staggering  could not be enjoyed due to the poor satellite reception though the weather was near perfect room service the first night was acceptable however on night two the food was not delivered when i called to check on the reason i was told that it was after  pm and therefore it could not be delivered the original order had been called in before  pm as if this was not disappointing enough our reservations which i had made on line weeks before the trip was somehow bungled up and when we arrived on friday we were told the reservations were for saturday though i had an email confirmation of that friday being our arrival date we were able to get a room but then had to switch rooms the following morning as the room we were put in for one night was already reserved the location and appearance of the hotel was not enough to outweigh the overall negative experience of staying at hotel russell 
 cramped small bed bar understaffed and waiter overwhelmed forgot one drink from order and it too  requests  minutes and asking the mixologist directly the get the drink
 they offered us an upgrade which i paid for as it was my th birthday and i thought my wife would like it there but rather than an improvement the the room was the worst ive had there and i have stayed a good number of times the bathroom was in a shocking state the main air conditioning unit was right out side the window so we couldn t have the window open all in all as great disappointment 
 the blinds in the bathroom needed replacing as they were very frayed also the ceiling needed repainting as there had obviously been a leak from the bathroom above 
 only thing was windows in bathroom need cleaned a lot of black mould on inside of them
 internal rooms had noisy central air conditioning units outside window
 we lived on the th floor and windows were blocked moreover when you turn on conditioner if smells dump so the room stayed humid all the time 
 the hot water was only warm in the shower bath was very hot by contrast and it didn t drain well
 i booked the junior suite on a last minute offer and got it for a good price however i would not have paid the full price okay you are in central london but the bathroom could have a better finish and the tv didn t have a great reception 
 room was very small but adequate for a one night stay breakfast was not included in the price but was available at extra cost 
 we were given what i would describe as someone s flat that they let us have for the weekend it had two separate bathrooms one with a shower the other with a bath the sink in the bath bathroom did not work the staff basically said oh well the room had scuffs on the walls the carpet needed replacing and the bathrooms were obviously in disrepair the room was supposed to be of modern design but fell flat they should embrace the history of the hotel and reflect that in their rooms and service 
 had stayed at the hotel a few years ago had a beautiful large room very disappointed with my return visit at  for our  night stay i didn t expect to get the smallest hotel room i have ever been in was amazed that they managed to shoehorn a bathroom into the space they had there was a bath too i am only  feet tall and i couldn t lie down in the bath a good shower stall would have made much more sense the bed was comfortable everything looked pretty shabby the windows were very dirty didn t matter that much the only view we had was of a white tiled dirty wall will not return here 
 it needs a little revamping and we were told a big renovation plan was soon on the way
 the room was pure value for money i booked a double deluxe room but nothing about the room was luxurious it was small poor decorated the bed was on wheels one of the lightbulbs on the ceiling was hanging out of the socket and the toilet roll holder was broken i expect much better than this for a room that costs more than  per night 
 room was average for a  star hotel  was blocked against my credit card on arrival i paid the actual  night cost of  the next morning with a debit card but was told it would take up to  week for the  to be released from my credit card 
 small room dated dark decor very much a quick business stay or ideal fro travellers i prefer crown plaza level of comfort 
 room small disappointing with the double bed pressed to one wall water serving bath and shower sink was luke warm not hot whilst compared to other clients  for our small room with no breakfast was clearly a cheap offering by comparison to others available the  stars should relate to all rooms not just how impressive the lobby staircase are 
 room was small with no view it was decorated cheaply very out of date and tired no mirror to get ready in 
 the design of the bathroom is appaling room  we could not wash our hands although some of them are smiley the front desk reception could have been more helpful 
 the showers didn t get very hot
 the staff were very unfriendly in both the reception area and the restaurant we booked a twin room for our  night stay and when we checked in there was no twin room available and we had to take  small single rooms no apology i emailed  times about my booking no response i rang the hotel  times as my flight was delayed no answer we paid for the room on check in and when we went to check out they insisted that we didn t pay and had to find the card receipt to prove we had paid when we gave it to the receptionist we got no apology again and were not asked if we enjoyed our stay i would not stay at this hotel again 
 nothing
 they did not book correct and desired room and expected us to pay for it anyways we were promised the room we intended the following day but that was a false promise 
 room was so noisy the constant road noise is terrible no sleep no double glazing just old sash windows 
 room they gave me was quite small and a little out dated needs a spruce up 
 not easy to get the wifi to work on my iphone poorly stocked in room tea coffee supply
 considering the price of the room the facilities are very basic only enough tea and coffee for two drinks in the room also the facial tissue and toilet paper were extremely cheap although i did not require them extra pillows and blanket were not present you could probably request some of the above however i do not think you should have to 
 horribly loud air conditioner called desk to find out cost to call our car rental they told me no charge and then charged l each about  total for two calls when we got our bill they did take it off after some convincing ridiculous charge for breakfast so we opted for local starbucks 
 the cistern of the toilet dripped all night told staff but indifferent and wasn t fixed overall the staff were unhelpful and tried to overcharge me no fridge even though provision for one was there small double bed 
 empty drinks bottle under bed lifts sign difficult to find and room signs arrows pointing wrong way did a circuit needed to go in opposite direction to  than was on sign mouse in bar ran up my seat 
 booked six months in advance with specific requirements but which were ignored in fact hotel said they did not receive them from booking com some staff less than helpful 
 lifts far too small didn t like having to use lift at russell square underground bathroom very tiny could hardly move shower screen didn t open so very difficult to use 
 nothing
 a bit worn out single windows our room was on nd floor on pub street side and some noice was coming rooms on nd facing inside yard had a really awful view 
 breakfast wasn t included in the price
 for  a night thought the room was a bit basic couldnt sit on the toilet without banging into the sink thought the bed wasnt the best squeaked every time you moved
 for a four star hotel the room was tired and needed decorating the furniture was dark and similarly tired the lightfittings needed replacing room between bath and sink was minimal making it difficult to access sink standard rooms very disappointing 
 traffic noise from the street i was on the rd floor the overall feel of the hotel is a bit old entry foyer felt dark and depressing others would probably say it was atmospheric but it just felt a bit scuffed on the edges with thick paint job to hide the dings 
 room size was smaller than expected the lighting was harsh with the overhead lights bed and pillows were very hard and uncomfortable our safe could not be fixed which caused us to put our valuables in the managers safe very inconvenient 
 the room is like what they have in italy i mean the single room is really small the overall cleanliess is ok i wasn t happy with the dust on the towel rack or the desk tho and the fact that a  star hotel doesn t have a fridge nor a scale in the bathroom was really annoying 
 the idea of free wi fi not being free after the first complimentary hour not clear at time of booking or booking in 
 had issues getting into the wifi 
 the room is terribly run down my family has stayed at the russell hotel since the war and i have known it since the s i ve never seen it look so drab assume it is cost cutting by a chain 
 the room they gave us was on the st floor no  it was a small room looking at the interior of the hotel it was s very dark room it had only  windows and you could look out only through the one the only thing you could see were machinery and there was a constant noise that did not stop at all day or night the elevator did not reach our floor we had to take about  steps as well i do not know if this room was given to us because we booked a value deal anyway it was not cheap also we asked the hotel to book us a taxi for the airport they told us it will cost  pounds we were  persons and we told them that we had  luggage  big and  small when the taxi driver took us to the airport he charged us  pounds because he said we had an extra bag in my opinion this is unacceptable i would not stay in this hotel again 
 i was put in a room with a tiny bathroom with an overhead shower it was not possible there to help my daughter who has a disability i have said about the disability in my request form it took  hours and a lot of my short holiday time to sort things out the initial receptionist s fault to give us a inappropriate room please train them to be more sensitive to guests needs 
 for the rate i paid it wouldn t be fair to complain about something
 not really that much of a problem but the bath takes up to much space in the bathroom so it is not so comfortable using the washing basin 
 the staff didn t speak english very well the junior suite was more like a double room and be sure to ask for a view to the square cause the air vent in the back yard will keep you awake all night the hotel itself need a bit of upgrade it s not a  star hotel 
 the hotel has seen better days the d cor generally was tired various fittings in the room were in need of repair notably the table which wasn t level and the sink tap which bled black bits after use the room also stank of smoke which got worse when the a c was turned on the staff were generally uninterested on early arrival i asked if i could have access to the room to get changed as i had cut my leg while travelling i wished to dress the cut and change any clothing which had blood on it two of the three staff members i asked were perplexed by the question despite being able to see the injury the third staff member offered me a band aid and use of the ladies toilets its not easy trying to open a suitcase in a cubicle five minutes in the room or any room and i would have felt a good deal better disposed towards the venue i particularly didn t like the attitude of the duty manager when we checked out and raised the issue of the faults in the room he implied it was our problem for putting up with it but on past performance ie the lack of effort while i m standing at reception bleeding i wasn t hopeful that anything would have happened i further was not impressed by the implication in pre arrival emails that the hotel was going to upgrade us as it was a celebration stay they didn t instead they gave us one slice of an inedible lemon cheesecake i remain unimpressed as the promised follow up from the hotel regarding our concerns hasn t happened breakfast was average service remained indifferent not what i expect from a four star hotel i wouldn t recommend or return to it 
 wifi was rubbish only free for an hour bath was really small neither of us fitted in it 
 toilet in bathroom was just not acceptable no distance between it and wash hand basin i really like a cup and saucer rather than a mug for my breakfast 
 difficulty getting in to the hotel as no wheelchair access that we could find and a lot of steps 
 wi fi does not work very well 
 would have liked a mini fridge and location of the hair dryer and iron was very awkward 
 decor a bit gloomy i paid  for the room yet was asked to pay a  deposit on arrival i don t like that 
 there were a few niggles the balcony window didn t shut properly and neither did the shower door but neither affected our stay and we slept great in a very cosy comfy room bar was pricey but it is london i guess 
 i must admit i had higher expectations i feel i get so much more comfort and luxury for my money in other cities e g berlin paris gothenburg a o
 noise from big fans running all night from courtyard outside bedroom window kept us awake 
 too many items missing every day e g no towels no water glass no toiletries no coffee door key did not work for me or for the kind member of staff who came up tp help i was constantly ringing the desk or going down to ask for something necessary the staff could not have been more helpful but supplies were poor and something i needed was missing every day 
 understaffing at reception means long waits to check in and check out 
 loo flush wasn t very effective bit of an acquired skill not enough plug sockets in room coffee terrible
 the room was the only let down it was very small and quite dingy the bed and bathroom was perfect although the window only opened slightly and there was a constant noise from a fan which was located above our window definitely recommend upgrading your room if you get the chance 
 the bed was comfy but very noisy every time i turned it woke me up 
 didn t have breakfast included in deal therefore  if booked night before or  the day of it continental was in one area and cooked in another had better for half the price in an ibis 
 offered a cot  alternative was a  upgrade bar closed early despite residents and staff still there so offered room service at inflated price our last experience was great this one poor money grabbing up selling procedures in place to steal your last pound notes lifts were too small 
 humming noise in my room first night so i asked for a change in both rooms i had always to try the card key three or four times before it worked temperature in old fashioned shower difficult to control 
 bath and bath mat very slippy even holding onto rail the mat slipped and i jarred my leg first time had hip replacement so a bit scary warned family but daughter aged  also slipped hurting her leg and banging her head also no toilet brush 
 not value for money room was noisy very dirty needed serious maintenace cramped with furniture definitely not the room shown on the internet site when making booking we will be telling anyone everyone not to go to this hotel including our travel agency contacts in various parts of the world concierge didn t even offer to take bags to room on arrival or assist with carrying up the fairly steep entrance stairs interior could do with a refreshment of decor to fit the outside heritage appearance 
 the hotel was rather tired and shabby around the edges needs redecorating and there was no hot water during the day but the staff did ammend my bill accordingly 
 tv not brilliant bed not that comfortable for me anyway i prefer a hard bed breakfast felt like i was in an exam hall 
 in evening about  pm they did not find anyone to get my luggage to the room
 although notified an early check in i had to wait until   overall aspect of the room is outdated
 no problems 
 bathroom was small 
 we had a very smelly room with an unacceptable view of water pipes with green stuff all over there are no fridges so we ordered an ice bucket which after the ice melted turned out to be unclean and had tissues and garbage at the bottom the rooms were not cleaned as it is supposed to be and the wifi wasn t working until we got a voucher key at the end they charged us  gbp for smoking which they hadn t stated it was a non smoking hotel the bathroom spaces are horrible which we couldn t fit into the bathroom to just wash our face in the morning how are we supposed to pay a lot of money if we don t get any good service or a decent hotel room suitable for regular sized humans not skeletons i wouldn t recommend the hotel to anyone i know unless i want them to have a bad time in london 
 checking in and out was appalling i was told breakfast wasn t included when it was i also paid  cash deposit on checking in and when checking out was asked to pay in full again as they had no record made to feel like someone who was trying to con them i have written to complain 
 the only let down with the hotel was breakfast we had it delivered to the room and it wasn t good raw egg isn t for me 
 when we first arrived we were asked of we wanted to pay on arrival or when we left we said when we left and were asked to leave a guarantee of a credit card which we dont have so we had a little trouble but paid for our first night in cash and paid the following morning for the next night 
 some traffic noise but no more than you would expect in central london shower temperature had a mind of its own i wanted to pay by debit card and the margin they tried to add to the bill to cover possible additional spend was excessive 
 i didn t walk into the room and have the same wow factor that i had when i approached the hotel there was large circle of damp in the celling which was a little off putting the view was disgusting at night it was very noisy from the central air conditioning units ex tractor fans that ran centrally through the hotel which was our view we did ask for an upgrade but there were no rooms available we reminded ourselves that we wanted the hotel for the location and not the room 
 roomes dated flaking paint no biscuits small wardrobe plumbing makes terrible sounds when other people use there bathrooms keeps you awake or wakes you up in the middle of the night just very very tied there are better priced hotels in the same location 
 room was tiny and poorly designed bathroom had no shaving mirror and was very poorly finished some rotten wood etc room smelled of stale smoke 
 only issue was very firm mattress 
 can t think of anything 
 breakfast was average there were a lot of staff working at breakfast time but trying to order poached eggs from a member of staff proved a challenge each morning the lunch here is poor and very expensive if you are to stay here best to eat elsewhere 
 paid extra  for upgrade as my wife birthday room was large but refurb above caused a lot of noise at am and double glazing had inch gap so road noise was extreme after complaining when checking out manager offered  refund i complained we shouldn t have been given that room no response also on first floor the metro can be clearly heard at am choose your room carefully 
 noisy narrow rooms with huge airconditioning machines next to the internal part of the hotel that make increadible noice overnight old windows without sound isolation 
 what i would suggest the hotel to look at long queues at the reception desk breakfast could have been better 
 bed soft and lumpy like most in england no satellite cable tv is a bit of an oversight 
 the bed was awful could not sleep because of the noise it made everything one of us moved the bathroom was small although had everything we required 
 i dont have any thing to say about this hotel it is full of happiness
 the room was tiny smaller than my bedroom at home so was disappointed considering the price we paid definitely not what i would expect for  stars would have complained but got there late after a long journey so couldn t be faced with dragging all our bags back down to reception
 room although i was told on check in recently refurbished was still tired looking and the lighting is terrible carpet old and scruffy looking sorry would not return 
 basic rooms and pretentious top hatted concierge 
 upon arrival we turned ac on freshened up and went out for the day when we returned ac was still not working london was going through a heat spell called front desk someone came up with a fan and told us there was nothing they could do so we suffered in the warmth of the night did not help that windows were only able to open about  inches next morning as we were preparing to head out maintenance came informed them to stop back as we were getting ready to leave for the day when we returned later that night ac still did not work i was told that it would not be repaired until the following week after i went to front desk to complain my family was later moved to two separate rooms at   at night instead of one room this is a very old hotel and it shows we were comped breakfast for two days for three people for our inconvenience overall i would not recommend this place 
 had a room next to air conditioning unit even though requested a quite room staff were good andmoved usto another room 
 not somewhere where i d like to spend time but a good place to crash for the night 
 had to change rooms twice once because door key did not function and second time because the room was too small for two very little space for clothes even in the final large room 
 room had a drain smell in the bathroom 
 the hotel could do with looking at second glazing poor fitting window very loud traffic sounds at night thus couldnot sleep very well 
 air conditioning unit was leaking it was reported to reception at approx   who said someone would be up to the room but no one appeared at all beds were uncomfortable bathroom tiny 
 recommendation from concierge for verdi restaurant overpriced for mediocre food saw italian restaurant next to lamb pub that looked a lot better for similar prices 
 room was shabby and needs the bathroom upgraded very small bathroom and poor free toiletries not impressed for  star hotel disappointing
 we booked a suite intending that our young child would sleep on the sofa bed in the event it was too small and we asked that it be replaced by an extra bed this request was declined on health and safety grounds which appeared implausible an alternative but smaller room was offered with an extra charge for an extra bed which did not address the reason why the junior suite had been booked in the first place
 the room was tiny and on the day of checkout they told us there was no hot water after   which meant we had to get up and leave long before the   checkout time probably a ploy on their part on sunday we came back at   to change for dinner and found the room was still being serviced 
 put at the back of the hotel above wher you have your deliveries the early morning noise was terrible also backed on to a public house which was also noises at closing time had poor sleep for the duration of our stay
 we had the window open by choice and were awoken by shouting and arguing in the square in the early hours of the morning
 few more coffee and tea in room no tissues no conditioner price of stay quoted did not include vat on bill
 steps at main entrance bell staff is very helpful with luggage but impossible for ambulatory handicapped
 breakfast was not included didn t realise and was very expensive  for a bowl of cereal was also put in a room that smelled terribly of smoke and because it was the last room of its type was forced to upgrade my room which cost  night 
 this hotel is starting to look very grotty carpets are stained and the cleanliness could be improved i have stayed for several years at hotel russel but having stayed in lots of other hotels it is definitely in need of some refurbishment also the shower facilities are rubbish there is not even a shelf to place your bar of soap 
 i was charged  as pre auth on arrival and then next day i was charged the room rate of  so i have been charged  expecting only to be charged  which left me short during my stay this is unacceptable practice i have been advised that it will take  working days for the pre auth payment to be refunded which is a disgrace 
 we booked a standard room six months before with the idea that we would be allocated a good one however we were given one on the th floor with a tiny wardrobe small windows facing into a quadrangle and an even smaller washbasin as this was for our th wedding anniversary we were very upset and complained the response was excellent and the replacement standard room was so much better management gave us a bottle of champagne and a cake to celebrate our anniversary pity we had to complain though 
 not flexable in late checkout i have to pay  poounds per hour starting  
 i ve stayed here twice and ever single time i get charged for a breakfast i did not have 
 small lobby area for relaxing uninspiring bar airco not effective in room 
 at one room service  aug the service was a little slow probably because it was sunday and i had no preserves 
 i would expect different varieties on the breakfast and the lack was the reason i didn t choose a breakfast 
 small room breakfast poor
 if you want peace and quiet this is not the hotel for you activity never ceases it is a very busy area 
 a little bit dark in the hotel and rooms 
 our room  had shabby furniture well worn a job to get in and out of the bath needed another handle to get in i reported loos electric plug on electric iron 
 booked a room with a view as read some poor reviews stating facing into a wall first room had a view but mould all round windows vile smell of damp only available other room faced into a court yard of airconditioning units the air con did not work properly in room and couldnt open windows because of all the noise from units outside was given a small electric fan and complementary bkfast as compensation but did not sleep due to heat lack of aircon and inability to open windows only one hour free wifi would not stay in this hotel again paid  for twin room 
 tv reception was poor but you don t go to london to watch telly 
 the only complaint i would make is that the windows would not open and also the plumbing in the bathroom bowl was a bit sluggish 
 staff at reception were rude and are not welcoming at all on checkin the doorman was unfriendly it s quite ok to smile room was smaller than expected and the tv screen was tiny it also did not work 
 careful as the website images apart from exterior of the building look nothing like the actual hotel artistic licence being very creative my junior suite was reminiscent of bad student accommodation nothing  star about the th floor i complained if i hadn t they would have left me to it stripped me if  i was moved to the th floor because they knew exactly what i was talking about and they tried to charge me they saw the light when i shared my opinion of the hotel threatened to move hotel don t do it there are plenty of hotels that are more comfortable lovely better value for money in central london oh the wifi did not work 
 the room was a little small for a  star hotel and the price we paid and the bed was very uncomfortable and creaked every time you moved 
 staff seemed hard pressed and overworked felt like we were stuck away and multiple attempts still kept us from getting enough room for three to comfortably share one room promoting the location as being close to attractions that are over a mile away doesn t seem right 
 staff member was rude at desk after  nights stay when our key cards stopped working telling us we weren t doing it right after another member of staff came to our room to and apologised for other member of staff when realised it was the cards 
 room on this occassion was a bit small yoo much furniture in it step very near bed to bathroom could easily fall would req larger room next time bathroom is small bath very deep can b awkward to get in to 
 the outside of the hotel is far more majestic than its interior 
 quite disgusted to find the bathroom full of mold in a hotel ranked as a  stars hotel
 the air conditioner was like sleeping with a jumbo jet engine starting and stopping next to the bed could not sleep with it on in our daughters room the air conditioner did not work at all and the room was very hot the room also smelt badly staff changed their room the next day to an upgraded room at no extra cost the rest of the stay was comfortable 
 none
 we have stayed here a few times but some areas of the hotel are looking a bit tired we were initially initially in room  but requested to be moved after the first night due to being woken at am by building work going on outside this was dealt with in a very professional manner by the reception staff and we were moved into  which met with our expectations also you have a resident mouse that likes to frequent the bar fairly late in the evening on a regular basis 
 i would never go backi have enjoyed better staff in  star hotels it is tired and needs quite a lot of money spent on it having said that the dining staff and food were very good
 the room we stayed in was pretty small the decor very dated and it generally seemed a little shabby compared with the spectacular impression from outside 
 the fact that the air conditioning condensers are located in the middle of the hotel which means you hear a slight hum all night
 the scaffolding around the building was inconvenient

 i did not identify anything i did not like 
 the cost of the breakfast for a family of  was extortionate 
 cracked sink and cracked tilein the bathroom old dirty windowns
 the bedroom door would not close so we had to change rooms which took a bit of time
 noisy rooms small poor breakfast wouldn t stay again
 need painting bit dated
 the bathroom was very dated and in need of minor repair
 extra bed was the worst breakfast queue was really terrible it s easy to tell people to come at a specific time though you have to arrange it somehow parking is far away and hard to come back because of road diversions 
 i wish you had wheat free snacks
 bit of a wait for a table at breakfast 
 housekeeping would bang on your door to wake you up at am this is your alarm very frustrated they will continue banging till you wake up until you told them not to clean up your room in such a morning hours terrible if we need clean up we would put the paper sign out to make up room no respect on guests don t expect this housekeeping will refill your bath gel they only keep those bottles which you don t want to use keep on giving you the same unwanted bottles say conditioner they won t give you slippers cotton pads tho they keep it in their trolley they won t refill your tea sugar when u finished your stay was more than  days doubt they changed your bedsheets too in such a long week 
 breakfast was an absolute disaster  minute wait for a table que to get brerakfast and then a que to get toast by which time your breakfast was cold if you got the toast first and qued for breakfast you toast would have been cold no tea or coffee offered for  mibns
 large queues for breakfast room was very crammed booked a room for  adults and  children no space to go in with a pushchair not enough lifts to cater for guests at times it took us  minutes to go down to the lobby restaurant 
 the room was spacious enough for a family because there is a sleeping sofa but when the sleeping sofa is unfolded the room door is blocked very small opening to enter the room
 housekeeping is not attentive not caring at all once when i returned to my room at night there is not even a piece of towels in the toilet also they won t give you enough set of towels even if they give you they just left a pile for you to sort they never refill your toiletries needs u have to ask specifically everyday the most essential things when you finished they won t refill it for you but only replenish those you already left in full bottles but with even more that is not what you need e g i have  full bottles of conditioners  full bottles of shampoo but none for bath gel body cream they don t provide you with basic needs like slippers cotton pads wools q tips but we saw it in their trolley not even refill teabags milk sugar rooms are considered not clean to normal hotel standard 
 expensive breakfast especially when you only want a coffee and croissant we went to starbucks around the corner for this 
 the traffic near the hotel was madness but that was likely due to the construction going on nearby once that is off the traffic will be better 
 air con control in room did not work properly had to ask reception to turn it off as it was freezing despite turning it to  degrees room very small for a  night stay dispute at check out regarding bar bill all drinks paid for as taken but still had some charged to room 
 slow elevators lots of wait time breakfast downstairs not the same as mezzanine and not as good 
 two large bath towels no hand towels or washcloths sink in bathroom about a foot lower than normal no tub no lip on shower area a wet room with water everytwhere no window to outside electric went out at   am no air to our room temperature got to be extremely warm well over  degrees interior room so it was pitch black up all night staff very unpleasant and not accommodating no announcements or explanations made regarding blackout very scary to be in a high rise in a city that s had terrorist attacks high rise fires and have a full power outage with no announcements no assistance or emergency lighting provided manager would not refund night we left before stay was over the night manager was horrible 
 the room was very much smaller than i anticipated it must have been smaller than it should have been because the receptionist informed me that it was very small as i checked in i had expected to have a small living area and that was why i booked this particular hotel as i did not want a traditional hotel room i did not get that 
 we had a leaky kettle they were light on with milk coffee in the room
 apparently the hotel guests before us had replaced  of the minibar drinks with their own and as a result we were charged for the  drinks not many cafes and food option nearby
 leaking shower electricity went out one night but we were compensated temperature in room hard to regulate 
 long delay to get into room even though i arrived after check in time room was dirty london eye view wasn t proper as blocked by other hotel shouldn t have to pay for the poor view
 very poor room cleanliness very disorganised housekeeping no towels in room on second day had to ask twice to get it resolved
 the bathroom needs update the layout is awkward and the faucet is old also the bathtub door is half way there is no way to avoid water on the floor while taking a shower secondly the beds are not comfortable enough the hotel can do a little bit considering the rate charged on each room lastly the air freshener used by housekeeping after daily cleaning smells terrible please change it 
 as a family of  with two young teenagers the room was a bit tight 
 bath was too high to step into safely glass screen was loose unsecured not enough tea bags milk sugar when we phoned for more tea bags a handful of everything else other than tea bags was given to us 
 the sleeper couch which acts as the second bed was uncomfortable and not practical when open as it was in the way of the door 
 was not that clean lot of things like cushion cover forgotten happened but staff was friendly ans fast breakfast queue
 was indicated that room family friendly room was  queen and  sofa didn t realise second bed was a sofa bed sofa not comfortable at all for  children  plus sleeping together asked staff if a better bed room was possible which was not offered to try make sofa bed more comfortable but nothing was done 
 seemed slightly shambolic i checked in around pm and yet i was told i wouldn t have towels until an hour later although when i actually went to the room the towels were there but the bathroom just seemed a little ehhh i kept finding stray hairs around the place that didn t belong to me bit gross 
 milk in the room fridge off breakfast staff  days out of the  i had to ask for coffee no one checked me all other people couples were asked perhaps a singles thing otherwise all good staff friendly and helpful location brill 
 since we booked studio room with  children the hotel did not provide extra sleeping pillows and blanket for the extra bed in the room 
 the only thing that mark the hotel down on was the room didn t have a window that opened not a problem with the aircon on but i like fresh air when i sleep the bed was a little uncomfortable but no bed is ever the same as your own the shower head leaked and made the floor wet but that wasn t an inconvenience to me more of a pain for the housekeeping i guess 
 the view from our room 
 the location was disappointing due to all the construction in the area which i was unaware of and which spoilt the view from my room i found the area very congested and noisy so would probably not use the hotel again i realize however that this is a personal preference and other guests may enjoy the area 
 the reception staff were really unhelpful and glum they never smiled almost any request was too much trouble in a hotel that has no swimming pool or public rooms the reception staff are key these appear to have been poorly selected trained and not proactively managed a poor reflection of the brand and hotel 
 i discussed my grievance with the duty manager who promised me she would address them upon checkout upon checkout i was told she was busy however she would email me with her findings as of now now communication have been made 
 room had a few damaged bits here and there very clean though the bed was big but i found it as firm as the sofa bed in our room air con seemed to be low in the day and fast and very cold in the early hours the other main issue was the lifts in busy times we waited  minutes as we had a baby buggy with us i had  gripe as i m quite ocd and don t like reusing towels i didn t receive the extra towels i ordered from housekeeping twice once each day 
 small for a family of  a little over priced for what you get however expected for that time of year not enough pillows house keeping knocked at our door fairly early which was disappointing as we just flew for hours 
 air conditioning was a problem we had to let them know twice before it was handled overall we very much loved our stay 
 booked a double room but had two single beds pushed together with two single duvets being with my partner we weren t happy as we had to sleep separated due to this also there is not enough milk coffee and sugar left in the room
 booking com has wrong room advertised for penthouse suite actual room very disappointing who is to blame here staff at reception not helpful about mix up house keeping is very average and be prepared for very long wait for breakfast in the mornings hotel is more concerned about money than the customer st photo is what you are shown of room at time of booking next photos actual room after spending over  pounds for  nights not happy hotel says there is nothing they can do about what images are shown of rooms yet all there images are copyrighted as per there website has been happening a long time but i believe they are happy for it to keep happening as when you have booked and arrived it s too late money is paid what you going to do attitude 
 the breakfast was not how i expected it also the breakfast staff on the restaurant was not as welcoming 
 i called the hotel to ask if i can pay the last night of our family stay by maestro debit card and the hotel staff confirmed this is possible when we checked out appeared it is not possible not a huge problem but staff are giving incorrect information 
 there is nothing significant to dislike as a way to improve they should provide the following two things especially for families with little kids liquid handwash in the bathroom bottled drinking water because the tap water may not be suitable for young children most hotels around the world in this price range do not charge for water for kids 
 breakfast was a little busy hit the peak you would wait but the staff laid out juice coffee for anyone in a queue breakfast quality itself was excellent
 it s a family hotel so sometimes there are kids running around like it s a playground apart from that all good
 there was not much options for the vegetarians in breakfast 
 cleaners woke up us too early in the morning breakfast wasn t worth the money and the food hall was too small so we had to wait in line for quite a while bathroom was awkwardly placed in between beds and room wasn t big enough for two people to walk around at once and there was no bin 
 i was disappointed i emailed and went to no end of trouble to explain what we wanted everyone was confused however we were told in the end we could upgrade for another   pound a night which annoyed me we did this as the room we had was dark and too small there was always confusion about things the two tvs were so quiet we couldnt hear them so every time we turned them on we had to call the maintenance man to turn them up which was so annoying in the end they left us with their remote so we didnt have to do it concierge was very good but depended who was on breakfast was ok but really really busy overrall i wouldnt stay again as i would rather be in the middle of the town we had to take a taxi to oxford st all the time 
 nothing not a thing my son and i loved it 
 the digging outside the reseption but of course this will be finished 
 they need to provide slippers the fridge needs to be bigger to give you an idea of its size it could only fit two   liter soda bottles 
 could have been more child friendly there were kids in the group that were  and six no facilities for children to play or be entertained 
 small and very dark room 
 sofa bed was terrible did not sleep whatsoever on the first night the bars were poking through the very thin mattress the amount of money paid for the accommodation i was expecting at least a comfortable bed everything else was terrific the location and cleanliness a 
 our first room was not to our liking we paid a reasonable amount for and upgrade the following day and we were much happier 
 booked the hotel room one month prior to the check in date to get the the best price possible however i found out that the room rate went down considerably before my stay more than  gpb for  nights communicating with the hotel management they did not agree to lower the price booking com made a wonderful gesture keeping its promise of best price guarantee booking com refunded me  gbp the difference in the price thank you booking com for keeping the promise 
 i did not like the bathtub with the shower the shower was difficult to use without getting water everywhere and the bathtub was difficult to get in and out of 
 restaurant is dual purpose good menu in the evening and very professionally run by the staff breakfast very ordinary i am afraid food from the cooked options cold toaster both of them are not user friendly especially when there are children using them tried the option of ordering breakfast next day as per the options eggs benedictine were excellent as was the restaurant service 
 the sound proofing of the room is terrible and you could here everything outside the door and in other room the layout of the room is very strange with the bed just beside the door and living room at the end of the room the location of the hotel is ok it looks very close to the underground but actually need to walk min from the station not impressed with the service of the staff either 
 they purposely not allowed my parents to check in one hour earlier since the room was ready the reason i wanted to check in earlier because my parents took a hours flight and need to take a rest before going out but the lady said the hotel policy stated check in time is at pm but before that she kept on allowing other customer non asian customer to check in i felt discriminated 
 it was a bank holiday so breakfast was not served at   am as expected we had to wait until    am so a rush to get to the airport for our early morning flight 
 only one point toilet paper holder doesn t work the roll keeps popping out
 disappointed by bar staff was ignored for ten minutes bar was quiet and staff were chatting to each other and when i finally got attention and asked for half a lager i was told rather rudely that i d need to wait until my allocated waiter was free i waited for a few more minutes i had been walking in  degree heat and finally gave up 
 there was a lot of construction in the area and the outside of the hotel is not picturesque but location makes up for this i would recommend asking for a room with a view i didn t even think about this when booking but was so happy with our room location on an upper floor the bathroom had a sliding glass door which lacked privacy this was not a big deal as i was traveling with my husband but might be weird if traveling with friends 
 tv didn t work poor lighting in room poor toilet roll fittings no dressing gown or slippers could have been cleaner room had no privacy as overlooked by other rooms also room overlooked restaurant not up to  star rating shower difficult to operate
 room temperature and debris falling from the air conditioning 
 getting woken twice up by drunken people shouting and hanging around in the corridor at am not what you d expect with security about only sorted it once we called reception bad night sleep 
 the traffic was a shambles outside the hotel
 there were no actual shops nearby i like to step out on the street and have things to look at we had to taxi to the main centre of london
 the room was a little hot during the night even with the air con turned right up as no windows that could open in the room
 impersonal 
 each day breakfast we had to ask repeatedly for a spoon for our coffee sometimes we had to ask several times even then sometime we never receive it not impressive major construction in front of the hotel it was loud with a lot of dirt and dust being thrown into the air careful you don t get it in your eye or breath too deeply everything else was good 
 poor wifi all staff were nice except ramzi at the bar who was unwelcoming and seemed to hate his job 
 the tv in the bedroom was inset too far into the cubby where only one person can see the tv 
 the images they showed for executive studio city view while booking had a great city view and when i physically saw the room there is this hotel right in front blocking the view it wasn t worth spending the money 
 crowded reception and queues room  room is next to something that makes noise during night which sounds like patio being opened appalling breakfast grumpy staff queues and restaurant crammed tables too close to each other not big enough for restaurant
 nothing location was excellent staff were super helpful and their italian restaurant a had extremely good good at reasonable prices
 we couldn t open the curtains in the morning because of the heat the airconditioner did not cope hot i don t know how you could stay there if the weather was actually hot the view from our room was waterloo station 
 noisy until  am adults and children talking in the aisles slamming doors and no one from the hotel asked them to be more respectful 
 cooked breakfast option was dreadful bacon looked like it was mechanically shredded no rashers just bits scrambled eggs tasted disgusting beans were only warm stuck to the much nicer fresh option triple room flooded as soon as shower went on spoke to reception who said she was unable to reduce the bill 
 too many issues to get sorted with the room bath plug not working no remote for the t v piece of skirting board kept falling off which had a nail sticking out had to keep asking to get tea and coffee renewed and for the sheets to be changed staff were very helpful and kept sending people up to sort problems but for what we were paying we expected more there were also a lot of roadworks outside the hotel which meant we didn t use the hotel cafe and it took longer to walk some places 
 a bit of construction around the area
 room wasn t cleaned very well during my stay cups were stained and they left my pjs on the table but despite this the place was quite clean overall 
 although i wrote through booking com two different request and question to the hotel i never got an answer for the question and for the request only on the day of arrival the breakfast area is very small and though we were lucky and never had to wait but if you arrive around am be prepared to wait some of the waiters are not always on the top of their job had to ask several times to refill eg milk and also came across a bad fruit salad once but overall nothing major and the good intention is there last thing we were unlucky i guess our room for  was on the nd floor looking to the train station meaning bad view and wifi was fairly weak in or room 
 would have appreciated a late check out say   pm for freshen up prior to train journey 
 not enough shower gel body lotion etc also i had to request our complimentary water it wasn t already in the room 
 not for business travelers i requested a quiet room but was awoken by kitchen preparation resteraunt etc every morning and evening
 strange layout with toilet in the middle of room with kitchen part and with sliding door didn t have much privacy breakfast area over crowded and difficult to move around does not seem big enough for size of hotel and food not really fitting of the rest of the hotel
 all in all a great hotel 
 would have preferred a room with a bath the room we were given was fine o list wanted to have a bath after walking so far 
 i liked everything 
 the hotel like many central london hotels for obvious reasons doesn t have its own car park and the excellent one right next to it that we usually use was closed due to road works and layout changes we found one online at upper marsh which had the advantage of booking in advance and has an attendant but it is more expensive and on getting home we found a nail in one tyre and a screw put into another and couldn t think where else it could have happened there are other parking options not too far away particularly if your vehicle doesn t need the high clearance room ours does will ask the hotel for parking advice in advance next time or fly 
 the room was a bit tired and the tea coffee facilities weren t replenished i had to ring up and ask it was delt with quickly upon the phone call
 excellent location very close to the london eye and the waterloo train station unfortunately this  floor hotel has  very slow elevators once it took me  minutes to reach my room at the th floor from the reception with the price they are charging it is simply ridiculous to have such an experience
 house keeping should be able to speak and understand english as when i asked for something we coudn t communicate
 bed a little hard and noise from the lift outside 
 couldn t open the windows to the room to let in fresh air and the pillows were too thin which made the sleep difficult
 receptionist attitude on checking in to be told they didn t have  rooms next to each other even though an email had been sent requesting this and a reply received back says no this had been noted and was no problems 
 i had to make an emergency phone call to australia and my phone wasn t charging i asked staff they said of course i didn t think to ask of cost they charged me  pound for a  minute call disgusting 
 n a
 breakfast was disorganised and needed more than one chef queued for a table and breakfast staff seemed stressed and not that helpful no toilet brush in bathroom which could prove unpleasant with people sharing especially children 
 bed was hard and squishy room  tutorial for shower and lights would be helpful 
 the hotel was clean and presented very well but the bar area looked like it needed some updating the chairs and carpets were worn 
 as above breakfast was expensive an food quality was poor you get better food at school 
 everything was great i thought we staying across the road which had a pool this one dident
 service in bar a little slow but that s just looking for a negative really 
 l italiano restaurant was pretty poor which is a shame because the hotel was wonderful but other than that it was brilliant 
 hair dryer doesnt work i can ise just once if you are booked on booking com they will give worst room in hotel my room hasnt got any view bathroom isnt so bad
 no body answeing phone so i have to come down for any request i requested city view and i was promised to get it if available but when i reach i discovered that all twin room has inside view which i hoped if they told me before 
 we pulled out the sofa bed and used the extra blanket which had a large yellow stain on it and the extra pillows had some stains on the pillow casing 
 considering the price you ve got to have a room overlooking outside 
 the fact that the shower flooded the bathroom due to the floor being all one level nice idea in principle but in practice it doesn t work well we had to use some of the towels to dry the floor also a member of the cleaning staff knocked on our door at about  to see if they could get in to clean the room checkout wasn t until midday and if we had checked out early then this could have been relayed from reception as to what rooms were ready to clean disturbed a very rare lie in for my wife and i view from the room was to the inner atrium so all you could see were more rooms this was a shame as being on the th floor it would have been nice to have an external window
 couldn t alight in front of the hotel as there was road construction blocking the front entrance
 we were  families and had  rooms one of the bathrooms had a clogged shower drain which resulted in the bathroom getting flooded and unable to be used the staff was unapologetic rude and refused to change the room they kept saying they would send someone to fix it but refused to understand that the family living there could not use the shower before starting their day they just shrugged their shoulders and had no solution to the immediate problem at hand which was that the guests who had paid to stay in that room had nowhere to shower they used the showers in the other two rooms we had but we lost out on our morning because of the delay the hotel is located in a popular area and is probably always busy so they really don t care the hotel needs to take their maintenance more seriously to avoid such situations they must consider training their staff to deal with such situations if and when required the only good thing was that they had fixed the shower by the time we returned at night 
 construction near hotel makes it difficult for taxi to arrive and depart and even walking road is difficult not a fault of the hotel though i had requested for early check in but room was not ready which forced me to upgrade the room hotel did not force situation forced me but the upgrade view was good with london eye big ben westminster abbey all visible from the room window 
 we wanted to buy a bottle of wine from the bar but they didn t have any that was cold as apparantly fridges were broken 
 the location of the twin rooms overlooking the inner courtyard very dark and gloomy this made us change to the next category room which was way better
 lots of road works going on having to pay for the internet also breakfast not included in the price expensive but in a good location 
 the bed was uncomfortable the tv was tucked in the corner of the room front desk staff was unpleasant 
 a significant drawback was the sliding glass door of the bathroom which meant that anyone using it during the night woke everyone else up with the noise of the sliding door and the bathroom light lit up the rest of the studio very brightly a proper door would give much better privacy to everyone inside and outside the bathroom 
 room was small for a superior room and poorly lit especially as it was an inside room and overlooked the inside wall of the hotel no view therefore needed better lighting within restaurant tables were not well laid and had to go searching for cutlery at breakfast 
 it might have been useful to know there are roadworks ongoing outside the front entrance this didn t affect me as i was at the back but some customers might have been bothered by the noise 
 i found that the receptionists although speaking reasonable english were sometimes hard to understand and sometimes it was hard to make them really understand what it was you meant they were however always polite and helpful 
 house keeping kept the door to the room open after cleaning mattress felt little lumpy elevators take forever to come to the th floor esp in the morning maybe good idea to allocate an elevator for the top  floors only to avoid the over crowd reception staff are not so friendly even little rude and ignorant 
 we were there from friday afternoon until sunday and our room was not cleaned on the saturday they did apologise and gave us fresh towels
 hotel italian restaurand had automatic   tip added small print bottom of receipt and i also left  for  meal so they got  for delivering  main courses failed to mention when i gave extra money disappointing
 extractor fan in bathroom was on constantly irratating noise when trying to sleep room was too hot air con was not working as it should 
 dealt with above 
 the only complaint unfortunately was the restaurant area which is nowhere near enough to cater for the number of guests breakfast in particular where the queues at peak times are huge and led to us missing breakfast our second day which we d paid for the warnings are very clear to be fair to avoid peak times but this isn t really the point everyone should be catered for correctly and be able to choose when they want to eat 
 the room which we had was meant to be a family room the bed was fine but the children had a sofa bed which was the noisey as hell any time the kids moved in there sleep if squeaked so much 
 the bed was not that comfortable and the temperature of the room was very hot even when the gauge was set to low
 food in the bar could have been improved i would have liked more choices for breakfast 
 the bathroom was a wet room but unfortunately when using the shower water spread across the whole of the floor so you could not use the other facilities until it had drained away which took at least half an hour 
 the drinks were slightly pricey but you have to expect that in london anyway 
 staff at check out were a little inexperienced but always polite and trying their best
 the promised sauna steam room were not working i phoned the reception they said they were but when i went down they weren t and i wasted half an hour out of a tight schedule needlessly they also didn t respond to my complaint about it very disappointing 
 we had a drink in the outside veranda at around   at   the following day our empty glasses were still where we had left them and the ashtrays were still overflowing gives a very poor first impression as this is next to the entrance 
 the biggest thing is the lifts always when to top floor first and make its way down when it got to our level the lift was full most of the time making us wait longer for a lift 
 more space between the door and the bed but that was a very minor issue road works made walking a bit roundabout but nothing to do with the hotel 
 see above
 the bed and pillows are very soft which i did not like also they need a good maintenance for the room facility and i wish if they can change the white lights with yellow lights to get the modern look of the room just an opinion 
 i felt the bathroom could be a little cleaner because the chrome in the bathroom was not polished up by that i mean just a wipe over with a micro fibre cloth it made me look closer and the bathroom shower cubicle especially taps ect could of been cleaner it was a shame that something so simple let it down for me 
 smell of drains sewer in bathroom brekfast too crowded tables too close and knocked by people children pushing past hotel not received booking regarding children
 room was a little small and the room window looked at the inside of the hotel
 there wasn t anything we did not like this was our rd visit to this hotel and it has been great each time we have stayed 
 loads of roadworks around entrance made access on foot tricky couple of sidelights in room did not work shower controls a bit of a mystery 
 stayed  days with my family for the london marathon not a good experience the hotel is always crowded and not relaxing rooms as soon as you enter in a small dark and narrow room near the door you find the bed in the middle there s a small bathroom and kitchenette and near the window another small room with a sofa additional bed satellite tv always bad signal so you find all the channels available but it is almost impossible to watch a programme without freezing and video problems interruptions the first sign that you see whan you arrive tells that guests have to expect long queues for breakfast and it is true queues for everything breakfast in the weekends check in elevators the queue for breakfast was the worst one considering that i was with my parents who had to wait  mins standing before sitting inaccurate room cleaning one day room was made at   the next day they didn t refurbish toilet paper and soap the next one they didn t remove used glasses and dishes the first day they started to knock at the door for service at  in the morning with people still in the room breakfast room cold and inadeguate for the dimensions of this huge hotel staff not very professional and trained with some exceptions location near waterloo station in front of the hotel there is a bus parking so when you are outside waiting for a taxi it is always complicate beside road works in the street so noise and long alternative routes to cross the street to find some bars overall this hotel was a terrible choice 
 we booked the restaurant in evening and when we went to pay we asked if we could split the bill as we were with friends and we had our son so ours was more and we were told it would take to much time and he was to busy to do it and we would have to do it ourselves so we then had to go off to one side and get our phones out to work it out for him we paid a lot to stay there and brought another  couples with us and i just felt his attitude was not in keeping with a restaurant and hotel like that and i would think twice about dining there again other than that the other staff were lovely and helpful especially the concierge who was so friendly and helpful 
 i did not like breakfast at all except the omletes cooked by chief restoran for the breakfast very small so creates long waiting list in front of restaurant 
 not happy with the service in the italian resteraunt very slow automatic service charge added even though it took over  hours for  course meal of which the one of the courses was a cold starter people that were seated after us were served preferentially
 the room is a bit dated the fridge is a bit too small since a large part of it was locked 
 the double room was very small with two twin beds and very little room given the price this was not worth it the breakfast was nice but cost additional  pounds per person also requested a  hour late check out and was charged an additional  pounds per room seemed unnecessary 
 at peak times the queue line for breakfast could be long but either the family room would be open additional seating upstairs or the line would move fairly quickly 
 i wouldn t recommend this location for travelers with cars as parking is difficult and the london congestion charge is prohibitive the breakfast lines were a little long but the staff managed very well and kept everyone happy and the breakfast was good 
 room cleaning could be improved 
 upon arrival our superior twin room was very disappointing no external view as requested even though i know not guaranteed our room which overlooked internal diners was very dark and hot during the night so no other choice except to sleep with the air con on which is not ideal had it stated upon booking that there was limited rooms with an external view i would not have booked this hotel as for the price you can stay elsewhere that has an external view a nice few days spent in london however would not stay at this hotel again 
 very tricky getting a reasonable gluten free breakfast despite putting it in the details and phoning ahead took  attempts to get something and several incorrect rounds of information being given despite a  year old being coeliac and waiting patiently for his gluten free food balcony was lovely but it appeared to be the only one missing outside seating which is a missed opportunity given the view room was a little tired and worn decor wise but a fab size 
 could hear people walking about the floor
 room i booked was small and dark with no outside window in my opinion it was misrepresented on booking com we would not have been happy there for  days 
 have stayed previously and room was excellent this time it was far too hot even after the maintenance had attended had to keep curtains closed as air con couldn t keep the room at normal temp 
 breakfast although nice and plenty of choice was far too expensive cheaper and better choice at local restaurants and bars
 it took some time for the cleaning service to do the daily cleaning
 air conditioning noisy no ventilation room to hot room service meal only warm breakfast disappointing queuing for table then table reset as collecting self service meal selfservice meal warm mushrooms and tomatoes cold 
 had to alert maintenance twice on issues which housekeepers should have picked up on and rectified before my arrival faulty lamp in bedroom and faulty shower head this was poor both issues were resolved swiftly and efficiently upon request however had to alert reception that i was being charged for breakfast on both nights of my stay as my rate quoted was inclusive of breakfast this was poor 
 i purchased the breakfast package but there was limited seating and a long line for breakfast we ate there twice and it was fine but i was disappointed not to be able to take advantage of something i had paid for 
 strange definition of city view we could only see the rails of waterloo station poor breakfast service queuing for  minutes before gettting a table in a conference room being obliged to watch children movie on a big screen while having breakfast poor quality of food especially bread we had to call the reception every day to have a complete towel set 
 please clean the windows since there where so many kids staying at the hotel there should be an entertainment room for them the breakfast room is too small and is a pity that there isn t i a coffee machine 
 standing in line each morning for breakfast was poor not enough tables to support hotel seemed to stand forever waiting on lifts to and from room level prices in bar where over the top and had the cheek to charge me   service charge serving me a beer over the bar 
 warmer welcome would ve been better appreciate  tired dirty but polite workmen walk in to reception may offend but think my money is as good as anyone elses breakfast was poor especially grey bacon left in bains marie or combi too long plaza opposite westminster bridge much better
 the breakfast buffet area was too small we were disappointed about no pool 
 the elevators are so slow and everyone is upset about it every morning there is a long waiting line for breakfast very frustrating to wait about  min for a table 
 overall the stay at park plaza county hall met my expectations the only inconvenience was the lifts it felt like you were waiting quite a while for lifts to call at your floor 
 parents room quite small no view they were looking into middle of hotel bathrooms could be improved very big step to get over into bath and no lock on bathroom doors 
 room was probably a bit smaller than expected and the staff were generally very good breakfast area was a bit crowded and the breakfast tables and seats were very close together breakfast service was a bit hap hazard particularly when queueing for eggs
 one of the hotel stuff ruined our bag by mistake they didnt offer any compensation
 restaurant is very unexciting and feels a bit like a cafeteria bar area unexciting too felt this was a shame as did not encourage use of either 
 city view through waterloo railway not nice at all limited number of adapters available at reception early breakfast recommended or longer waiting time 
 breakfast was average with some of the food a bit bland lifts were terrible and expected better but overall a good stay
 the breakfast option seemed good but we didn t book it as it was too expensive per person perhaps more pricing options would have encouraged us to take breakfast in the hotel 
 the breakfast is so basic for its price the food assortment is very limited for the price of  pounds i can go and have much better breakfast in the cafe i also recommend to come earlier for the breakfast because the restaurant is not big and possibly you will have to wait for the table
 there was no welcome water bottled at the room and there was no black tea in the mini bar the tv is located in one side and it hard to watch tv from the other bed side 
 room  and the filthy windows which were so dirty you couldn t see out of them staff were happy to show us alternatives but perhaps it would be better to employ a window cleaner 
 we were able to hear our neighbours which was a bit offputting also we could hear the restaurant noise as it was directly below us we didn t take advantage of the breakfast which we were glad of as the queue for breakfast was very long at   am 
 wardrobe inside light was not going off when closing the doors so was lit all night poor views from our room though just used it for overnight mostly wifi poor speed 
 rooms were sometimes not made during the day restaurant was not big enough to cope with breakfast
 this room was not worth  night i believe that the premier inn adjacent to this hotel would have offered a more comfortable room with better bathroom facilities the amount of space around the bed offered little chance of decent movement around the room the wardrobe was inadequate in size to offer enough clothing storage space for  room guests the bathroom sliding glass door could only be fully closed using great force is liable to break should a strong young man use such force in this case it could result in that person sustaining injury i would suggest that you use this tiny room as a storeroom 
 room cleaning was great when they did it but there were a couple days we came back from being gone all day and they hadn t gotten to our room yet not a big deal but worth mentioning
 breakfast could have been better coffee was very poor on the  mornings 
 some of the bathroom towels were frayed and worn looking 
 the cost was a bit too expensive but considering the location i ll make an exception the noise of people opening and closing doors was immense also the sound of water running through the pipes from upstairs was very loud it was evident everytime someone flushed the toilet the sound proofing needs a bit of work to say the least lack of usb chargers in a modern hotel is questionable 
 the fact that you couldnt open the windows unless you was on pent house level was misleading i did not like this at all the temperature in the room was constantly boiling even if heater was off i asked to move room and turned out i couldnt as none of them have windows not good 
 reception for my mobile phone
 a picture is worth a thousand words added photos are not taken from a construction site this is central london and what you see through your window if you can after paying about euros per night in a  star hotel not like the amazing photos on the website right needless to say the view is accompanied by construction noises starting at   am in the working days sure they do have double glazed glasses but i am a very light sleeper and requested an upper storey room for this reason in my reservation seems no one reads or cares what is written there in the room there was no coffee machine as declared on the booking com website the hot water pressure was so low that a quick shower took ages housekeepers knocked our door two times by mistake as they thought we need additional sheets or a sofa bed after all yes the room was clean excluding the muddy windows and spacious but the rest was enough to ruin our anniversary we will never step in park plaza again even if it is the only hotel in town and i will make sure that this outstanding quality will be seen and known by as many as other people so that same cannot happen to them 
 we had an internal view quite disconcerting would have requested to change it had we stayed longer
 it was very very pricey to stay here the breakfast on day  had a long line and it did not seem that they had an organized plan to seat people for breakfast 
 i wish the staff could speak better english i found it very difficult at times to be understood and for them to understand me and the food and everything was nice but the service could have been faster i m not sure why waiting staff didn t think to come back after they ve dropped your meal to see if you would like something else or tea coffee dessert etc a small thing but annoying 
 because we stayed six days and ate the breakfast on site every day because we paid for the included breakfast it would have been nice if they had changed up the menu from one day to the next it would have been really great if they had offered french toast pancakes or waffles sigh but that said we had no problem with being seated right away as some reviewers have and the food was fresh and hot with plenty available 
 the room size was smalle the temperature in room very hot there is no buses or tubes stations neer from hotel the waterloo station min walking from the hotel the hotel doesn t provide room dining  hours and just one restaurant in the hotel which is italian restaurant 
 the rooms was not big enough for  or  persons we asked for  beds but did only get  bed and  crap sofa the wc dosen t have a proper door so there is no privacy 
 hard to find anything wrong my single room was tiny but this is normal for central london 
 hd tv was confusing and i am not convinced was working properly that is itv continually showed a sky trailer i could not get any itv programs tv guide was also not working 
 the shower didn t work and wasn t looked at until the nd evening of our  night stay after we spoke to reception the afternoon of our day of arrival the following morning and afternoon the room was incredibly hot despite also informing reception of this on the  occasions we complained about the shower we were told the room temperature was controlled by computer and that it would be adjusted this was never done i was also given a discount card and told i could use this for a  discount on the hotel bar and restaurants when i purchased a rum and ginger at the bar i was told this discount was for soft drinks only and charged the full   for my drink that s not a typo it was nearly  
 nothing 
  frontdesk is soso i asked for an adampter wehn i checked in and was told i have to come tomorrow morning  am when i came eary in the following moring they said it is first come first get and dont have any so i have to buy one in b suggest the hotel to tell the client clearly what you can help and if you can t let us know as well  the price is higher compared with its service 
 the underground waterloo is very busy between     am we had to wait for six trains before we could ride along in a cart stuck like sardines in a can we arrived at the wrong chain reception showed us no smile at all didnt appoligized that we are at the wrong location she just did not care at all but this is the case in all london hotels i ve noticed specially with the east european staff members their accent showed through the sighing especially so rude spending  a night should not give this service at all most annoying point was that we mentioned that we want a business invoice and mentioned it on booking com but they refuse to give us ons only after consulting the manager we were granted what we wanted as a business traveler this is not convenient and very time consuming and annoying 
 our superior twin room was small and dark overlooking a narrow internal courtyard which meant that we had to have the light on at all times of day not very comfortable and not good value 
 i requested a higher floor room but assigned a st floor room in the room the door s inside key was broken so could not lock the bed was terribly hard and i had a backache next day 
 the airconditioner was warm and i found out just on the last night when i asked for a fan that the temps can be dropped by the staff it would have been nice to know that is advance pre authorization on your cc is needed in advance if u want to order room service should be part of the initial cc pre authorization i shouldn t be paying each time i order something 
 not much to complain about perhaps the price but then again given the position 
 the burger was a bit scary other in our group had the chicken burger which was ok i requested a late check out the night we checked in the receptionist said to call in the morning a charge of pnds an hour i called in the morning at am to arrange the late check out only to be told it was now not ok they need the room after that there were  phone calls through out the morning up until   a little funny they were desperate for this room and we had to experience  hang ups through out the morning not relaxing knowing they want you out as soon as possible 
 nothing couldn t find fault with anything didn t like not having time to use the spa 
 there is nothing i didn t like you would have to be a very miserable person to complain about park plaza county hall
 had to wait  hours for our room ordered delivery and had to go downstairs in my pajamas to get it the shower water overflowed into the kitchenette area and then all the way into the bedroom our entire room was soaked the room was freezing the entire time despite the heat being on the maximum level 
 the sofa bed was hard the pillows were far to soft and useless as when you put your head on them they disappeared and gave no support bring your own room far to stuffy and hot air con made it hotter if stayed longer would have complained about heat
 children s sofa bed was very uncomfortable frosted glass bathroom door didn t afford much privacy 
 no milk in room for drinks shower unable to regulate temperature although i asked for twin as i stayed with my son the  beds were positioned too close like a double bed much too tired to complain that evening as we were late checking in and just wanted to sleep
 i booked reservation fee days before arriving date after i checked in i found the price was dropped a lot however booking still charged me the original price i booked i hope booking is able to alert customer wht the recent price is 
 i had to wait for my room to be ready even though i d arrived late afternoon and also i had to wait for a table at breakfast 
 n a
 didn t like coming home because had a great time 
 valet parking should be cheaper hourly rates which then would create more business uk needs to adopt free valet parking and get away from the system what is deemed as luxurious and get with the times 
 a solid door on the in room bathroom instead of a sliding frosted glass door had to pay for wifi 
 when i booked i requested a room on a high floor with good view we got a room overlooking a building site the hotel said you had not forwarded this request i was very disappointed as i had booked last year felt let down 
 nothing
 pillows far too soft didn t sleep too well a nasty smell of stagnant water in the bathroom
 nothing overall an amazing hotel 
 room was a bit small for  adults and  children not much room to move around in my husband requested a special children s pack for my daughters birthday which included ice cream and it arrived much later and all melted left in our room also when they removed it and we requested another one it took almost an hour i had also informed the hotel it was my daughters birthday but nothing special was done about this if it wasn t for my husband paying extra for the kids package we could have been at any hotel 
 no complaints
 rooms facing the lift suffer severely from the noise of the safety locking mechanism i relocated wifi throughput erratic tv cables and remote had been removed by an earlier guest helpful and well meaning but not very efficient staff took  days to fix this spa sauna steam room tiny have to ask for facilities to be switched on for  per night i would have expected the breakfast to involve something like an omelette without surcharge little things like lights hinges taps would benefit from some adjustments 
 rooms too hot at night ambient temperature too high and felt putting air conditioning on in march a waste of money and not very environmentally friendly 
 the walk in shower was not well designed water went everywhere every time you had a shower however it wasn t a major problem 
 central located hotel close to amenities public transport and various forms of entertainment the staff were professional and friendly 
 scary open elevator 
 the bathroom had a frosted glass door with no lock which may be off putting for some people 
 nothing amazing service staff rooms and facilities 
 i thought breakfast was a little too expensive my only dislike 
 bed was not ok bad comfort bad sleep tired during stay airco was not good way to hot in the room staff member treatened my girlfriend as a prisoner because she did not had the room card with her 
 the bed was very low which if you are over  foot tall was disconcerting 
 i still feel the cost for the hotel was expensive and we will not use it again 
 nothing 
 every morning especially our last morning the house keeping would call very early to clan the rooms and wake us up on our last day they knocked at   am
  bath room is not cleaned after room cleaning a lot of hair can be still found in the sink  every evening after whole day visit find the room card doesn t work each time i have to go down to the reception for validation even i have paid all my stay  we live in the family room but they only give bathgel and shampoo for max  persons every evening i have to call for extra for rest of the family 
 the breakfast was lovely with plenty of option just the scrambled egg was nasty very rubbery and bland
 wasn t happy with the main shower head not working properly coming out at different angles and water ended up on the ceiling and the floor making it very dangerous to walk on
 the sofa bed was not that clean so i phoned the reception asking for cleaning the bed and the cleaning staff came but they were not nice i waited for the lift for around  mins  lifts are not enough 
 shower bath water was cold called reception several times and nothing was sorted came in on saturday night and the staff on reception was so close with each other flirting and touching each other made me feel so uncomfortable the room wasn t cleaned even though we left the sign on the door i feel disappointed with the stay when paying so much money i would like to be able to be in contact with manager as i would like a refund 
 breakfast was not included and really should had been for the price i paid 
 when we arrived our city view consisted of the train station next to the hotel asked for a room with a proper city view and the only available room was the penthouse at cost decided to upgrade and it was worth every penny 
 carpet was a little shabby and bathroom had seen better days but these are not cheap or easy fixes the room was internal and the only window faced onto the restaurant so there was no natural light not a problem for me pitch black makes me sleep like the dead but my sister wasn t keen but for only  nights it was perfectly liveable 
 just need reception staff to work on their grasp of understanding the customer it took a few attempts to make myself clear
 the room was to hot and the air conditioning system would not respond to the settings as it was only one night we put up with it but had our stay been longer we would have had to complain 
 i made a book at booking for two adult and one  year old when coming to the hotel i had to pay extra for the child not ok
 lack of parking mitigated by valet service which however costs  for  hours which might put off some people 
 lack of extra pillows our room smelt when we first went into it wasn t pleasant we waited  minutes for a lift and ended up taking the stairs our room keys kept failing to let us in our room we must of had them re programmed  times when we returned to our room about pm there were children playing football in the lift area near the restaurant which i thought was really bad as no staff seemed to be stopping them i requested early book in but was not given this although they stored our bags for us which helped i wouldn t stop here again for money we paid 
 nothing it was all good 
 first room wasn t ready came into a dirty room and the beds had no sheets 
 the room did show some wear and tear e g loose tiles on the bathroom floor 
 everything was fine always enjoy staying here
 appalling breakfast organisation poor quality food items staff couldn t care less when complained at time curtains hanging off end of rail bathroom wiped clean but encrusted deposits around fitments there was more but they re not worth my time
 service completely incompetent unhelpful only room service staff knew what to do the rooms were dirty the amount of dust in the wardrobe was shocking i have never seen something like that in ta room which costs  a night in central london 
 i was in room  i think and the elevator outside clicks and clocks like a gun every   minutes but shabby to be honest i don t like gun s i am comparing your hotel to the park plaza victoria in amsterdam that hotel is top banana 
 would have liked a table and a second chair in the room because the settee was used as a bed for our stay we hadn t enough furniture to relax on 
 sofa bed uncomfortable for children short wait for a table at breakfast 
 queue for breakfast although it was only  mins it s hard with young children
 the gym equipment was ok but not as high standard as the rest of the hotel however it had a gym which is unusual for a london hotel in this price range 
 everything else i booked an executive studio room and upgraded to city view the other week the stay was for myself and my parents i havent seen them in a long time and it was meant to be a family weekend out before i get married firstly booking com has advertised the room i was booking with a picture of the room with a view to london eye or big ben did we get that view not at all and we could barely get in the room as the sofa bed was so close to the door my mom is disabled so i went to the reception and told them that they must have gotten the room incorrect so they changed our room to a junior suite which just had a window overlooking the waterloo train station i have told one of the staff members that we upgraded on booking com and had to have a view to big ben or london eye which they said is not their fault and theres the shard building somewhere far away that we can slightly see and because the shard is in the city this is the city view you can say that pretty much about anything i appreciate they changed our room to a bigger one until i realised that the spa bookings i have made for myself and my mother have not been made complained to the reception they said its not their fault again and they can try and fit one of us in at some point during our stay there were missing bulbs in pretty much every lamp in the room my moms duvet had a blood stain on have photo proof i have also requested to have an extra duvet as my parents dont like sharing one had to ask twice although it was written in the notes the next morning after the room was cleaned the extra duvet was gone again i have never had a worse stay in a hotel in my life 
 we are a family of  on arrival first day complementary toiletries not enough had to call house keeping for more second day was out most of the day sight seeing got back at   room just cleaned left us with  towels only no toiletries had to ring house keeping again 
 found the bed for the children very uncomfortable it was a pull out sofa bed unfortunately they didn t sleep very well we had a studio room with a different layout on this occasion the rooms were only partitioned with a desk and pillar rather than the bathroom which makes it more practical so it wasn t as seperate as we would have liked and as easy for them to get to sleep unless we turned our lights off too might be worth requesting this with the hotel 
 the fact that the restaurant shows you special deals but they don t actually offer it you i found the room freezing even after turning air con off and switched to warm and the fact that i paid extra to have breakfast in bed and they only brought my husbands breakfast and forgot my porridge and only came back to say they had forgotten it as we was about to check out so i paid for breakfast as a package and then extra for room service and never recieved it and never got a refund 
 the key cards weren t that great found ourself standing there for ages to try and get in to our room also the room was very hot even with the aircon on lowest temp so didn t sleep that great
 breakfast area often overcrowded room requires some maintenance carpet soap holder in shower house keeping was often done relatively late 
 a little busy so had to queue for breakfast but was half term and guidance is given on busy times ate breakfast in ground floor bar area on second day but food was a little cold 
 staff at the reception wasn t helphul at all was asked to pay although had paid for the stay the evening before after explaining my situation she requested a different card being not very fluent in english i couldn t properly defend my position after what she asked my nationality and told me you can go very surprised that a central london hotel can be so rude and insensitive deep disappointment and unpleasant feeling for the rest of the day 
 we booked a studio with a double and sofa bed the sofa bed is so bad i literally went to a e with severe neck pain do not sleep on the sofa bed also very surprised that no ow came to clean the room until  pm we had been out since am 
 limited channels at tv limited sugar for tea hahaha and very limited milk it was not which we was expected for the value which we paid
 useless staff in bar we had to ask five times if we could order drinks each time they said they would take our order at our table the final time we insisted they took our order at the bar but still no one made any effort to organise drinks it wasn t busy i have no idea why the four staff were unable to provide an adequate service it was bizarre 
 your staff did not know where to pool is and instructed me to visit the neighboring park plaza building to be humiliated when i asking if i have my room card and if i am a resident the talk continued for  minutes where every service which i originally came for was not available hence this hotel although modern and pricy is nothing more than a unorganized scam but good job you took my money you are good capitalists
 the rooms have no windows and very much dislike the air conditioning the rooms are too hot and not comfortable which meant i didn t sleep until am you can hear the lifts all night and they are noisy and i m a light sleeper also every time i ve been to the hotel my room is never ready much preferred the park plaza hotel across the road 
 room was too hot could not get the temperature down
 the rooms were not ready on time at pm the queue for breakfast not complaints just points to note 
 a couple of little niggles fridge part of the minibar wasn t cold enough and the room was too warm despite having the air con on max perhaps it being so cold out meant they turned the heating up 
 the temperature of the hotel our room wouldn t warm up even after putting the temperature to max also the microwave wasn t present in the room as was expected to be included 
 queuing for the restaurant at breakfast on checking out at midday decided to have a coffee in the bar area but the staff were still clearing away tables from breakfast seemed to be in no great rush this wasn t the case when i last visited last year
 paid for upgrade to see london eye big ben eye was fab view couldn t see big ben did complain and got half of upgrade fee back if you want to see big ben too need higher than th floor also for price we paid would have been nice to have breakfast included an additional  a head didn t seem fair when spending over  on a room 
 shower creates a bit of a puddle as the door didn t shut properly
 i paid for an executive suite with city view as it stated on the website what i got was a room on the  th floor overlooking the side of the park plaza westminster across the road and part of the construction site from waterloo train station very unhappy about this i was told at reception i could look forward to a great view from my room the windows were filthy to so good luck taking any photos of your stunning view james quirk
 minor things that i wouldn t even put the hotel down over it was our personal preference 
 room was a little too hot even when air con was in cold
 additional beds for kids sofa bed was very uncomfortable and smelled because of humidity air conditioning was bad too no fresh air can be found inside building 
 staff rather rude and dismissive on check in which was nt a great start after a long journey check out was lengthy so opted to drop keys in the express box bedroom layout was odd tv in front to dresser instead of a mirror that was on the inside of the wardrobe door which then had to be left open which wasnt ideal room was so hot air con had no effect and no window could be opened bathroom door is frosted glass and faces the bed so no matter how comfortable you and your partner are is still really not good little confusing as there are  park plazas next to each other food drink is dear but its london so nothing close for a drink unless you walk to the southbank which we did but everywhere closed around   so hotel has a captive audience as it were overall a nice but pricey stay 
 check in staff not helpful lobby small and therefore always crowded breakfast room feels like a fast food restaurant far too small when hotel is full especially with families they call it executive rooms although there was no executive lounge elevators too slow for number of guests have stayed often in london but this was the least appealing hotel there are certainly many better options 
 poor cleanliness very bad wifi connection the bed is uncomfortable it really hurts my back and nick very slow service breakfast asking for extra money to get something like omelet so i cancelled
 danish pastries croissants at breakfast were cold would have been nice if warm or if there was a way to heat up
 the only thing i didn t like was the fact that i had to come home 
 we paid for internet and the tv kept says no signal so we were unable to use it other than that our experience was amazing we would definitely visit again 
 dressing gowns were tatty and too small towels too looked a little tired bed seemed hot due to plastic cover 
 not enough lifts which means if you are on one of the upper floors then be prepared for waiting up to  minutes for one to arrive 
   min queue to get to breakfast both saturday and sunday we did not arrive at the same time is not acceptable to a  star hotel our room was not cleaned after the first night until we asked for it around   in the afternoon 
 breakfast had to queue for about  minutes and then when we did sit down had to queue again for hot food which wasnt being replenished very quickly so choices were limited not good value
 the duvet it was too thick heavy and very lumpy made sleeping uncomfortably hot 
 the most awful hotel that i have ever lived in the staffs were not friendly and nobody helped us with our luggages when we checked in till we asked the heating in the room was either extremely too hot or too cold we couldnt adjust the temperature in our room we had to call to the reception to let people do it over and over again we stayed there for three nights and none of the nights were comfy definitely not worth for the money that we paid very disappointed we would not choose this hotel again and we are not recommend this hotel to anyone 
 overpriced for new years eve paid  per room per night and when asked if we could have a room facing the fireworks they wanted another  per night total extortion dirty small and below average room wouldn t pay more than  a night had to take  small children outside to watch in the freezing cold at  pm because they would not let us have a room facing the fireworks rooms were empty because people refused to pay  they wanted 
 leave ahead at least a day for your laundry cos the dryer will take at least  rounds   hours per round to do your clothes half dry 
 the room wasn t ready when we arrived at  pm our room should have been available  pm the sofa bed was not very comfortable 
 the beds were way too soft to my liking the shower switch wasn t working housekeeping seemed to forget their items in the room for  nights i stayed there 
 arrived a little early for check in and the room wasn t ready they took our bags and said i would be contacted by txt message when room was available no sign of a text by   pm so called up to the desk and room was ready room was small fixtures and fittings were poor tap was falling off the sink 
 at fisrt the sofa bed was broken but we get change to another room
 we were a group of friends and the sofa bed was extremely uncomfortable you could feel the springs through the mattress
 we were  parents and child the added fold up bed was positioned where you would expect the fixed bed to be and vice versa the elevators seem to be insufficient for the large number of rooms when checking out it was very difficult to actually make it down to recepcion because every time the elevator passed it was already full with people and no matter how nice a hotel might be when it s time to go it s time to go 
 response to queries i didn t get any requested a room with a view when booking and in a follow up email as it was the first time in london for my children appreciate it may not always be possible but just didn t get any response also asked for information about family activities on follow up email as this is mentioned on the website again no response disappointing 
 we had to wait around two hours after the time you could check in because our room wasn t ready 
 the bed is not comfortable the breakfast is always crowded limited options opposite to what was mentioned we had to wait for in long ques for a table for breakfast sometimes we were offered to have have breakfast in conference meeting rooms in another floor so as not to wait we were told that the breakfast is the same which was not as there was items in the main restaurant but not where we had our breakfast however they played cartoons which was amusing for the kids 
 didnt like that although featured in promotional pictures there was no way the london eye could be seen from anywhere in the hotel also that the bathroom sink was blocked the burgers we ordered from room service came with no condiments no ketchup in the burgers or as compliments and that it took room service another  mins instead of the couple they promised to brings some by which time we had eaten the burgers to prevent them getting cold very poor also the pasta in the italian restaurant was poor and our we were given an additional dish we did not order 
 there were no face wash cloths provided this was a challenge no onsite variety store selling basic vacation items such as varied drinks confectionery items vacation supplies likely to be required 
 the room inside room with view of the dining room could not open the window could not control the air conditioning was advised the morning after our stay that we needed to ask reception if we needed cold air as it was controlled from downstairs the tap on the bathroom sink was very loose the tap on the bath was very stiff the setting was programmed for hand shower use so my friend got quite a surprise soaking when she tried to turn on the shower and one of the turning spikes handle broke off in my hand when i tried to turn it could not control the water temperature so ended up filling the bath from the hand shower unit with boiling water and taking a bath when the water cooled down advised reception of the issues after breakfast and  plumbers came up to the room straight away where they proceeded to tighten the sink tap and look at the shower bath controls both agreed that they were not right they also pointed out that there was no visibility of the hot cold bath shower info on the taps as this appeared to have rubbed off we spoke to the manager who offered to refund our breakfast but not the cost of the room cannot fault the staff polite and efficient but a little disappointed that no refund part refund was offered the front of house manager gave us his card and advised me to email these details on our return 
 there were a few lights in the room that just wouldn t turn off so it was illuminated even during the night also the wardrobe handle just fell off the first time opening it no major issues though 
 the shower easily overflowed the mattress topper had gone lumpy 
 room was quite cold only air conditioning was available and not needed considering its winter buffet breakfast was nice but area is too small considering the number of people we saw each morning luckily with a  year old we were early for breakfast only saw queues on leaving tables very cramped and area cold with lobby doors constantly being opened small things i noticed were no facecloths in bathroom or cleaning liquid cloth for kitchenette 
 we were promised a room with bath and kitchen but did not get this there was no kettle even in the room until we requested one we chose this hotel which was not really as convenient as we would have liked specifically for this reason on complaining we were offered our last night in the room we had requested an offer we did not take as it was too late to pack and unpack for one night 
 ripped duvet cover shower was rubbish no more that a trickle we had to queue for breakfast we were located in the bar on the lower floor as the restaurant was extremely busy we had tiny tables and it was was freezing not happy about this at all 
  food choices of breakfast are too limited
 reception staff we paid in full upon arrival and got charged the entire amount  times again they were argumentative and refused to believe us so we had to show them our account statement we also got charged small random amounts each day and there were  extra things on our mini bar bill that we didn t have it was lucky we checked the charges they refused to be at all apologetic or seem empathetic 
 room was very compact for  people if we had been a hurry to get out it is difficult for  people to not keep running up against each other the big heavy glass sliding door on the bathroom was noisy to move 
 i have stayed in this hotel many times but on this occasion i got one of the smaller rooms didn t like the glass door on bathroom 
 room felt slightly damp 
 i was a little put off by the style of the bathroom door translucent glass slider because it didn t allow for as much privacy as i would like i also wished they had mentioned at check in that you use your key card to activate the light switches because it took us a few minutes to figure that out when we got in maybe they said it and we missed it 
 the advertising pictures of the hotel make it look very nice but much different when you experience it yourself the check in was delayed by about  minutes yet had to go up a second time asking about when will we be given the key to the room very poor check in and unproffessional no sink in the room had to use water from the toilet sink to boil the water there is no toothpaste in the bathrooms to brush your teeth with the access to the internet on the tv is blocked very dissapointed can find much better hotels for the same price 
 toiletries were a bit scarce  bottle of each for a family of  is a bit too little had to ask housekeeping for more every time which they provided with no problems
 nothing 
 more choice of films on tv
 ground coffee and a biscuit would have made it better 
 booked for new year s eve spent  for two rooms two nights because told london eye view london eye view bull had to go outside and stand in street after bought tickets home page shows london eye they wanted another  pound to upgrade shocking
 booked executive suite with view but the view we got was rail way station which was a bit disappointing was hoping for river eye view also there were  of us staying there but only given  cups wine glasses etc and when we called room service reception to request another glass we were told it was on its way but never arrived 
 the staff were a little slow but vert polite so no faults 
 we ordered room service after waiting an hour for it they missed the milk for our tea and the pizza base was doughy we were left to it at breakfast and had nearly finished before we managed to get some ones attention for a warm drink then they only brought us one and not two when checking out we never got the option or chance to give any feedback about our stay 
 the amenities in the room such as plates and utensils are not properly washed before being placed back in the cupboard the bathroom sink was clogged the first day we came in the bed is not very comfortable back support is not adequate there is not enough room for breakfast
 literally no wardrobe space we stayed for  nights and had to leave our clothes in suitcase not sure it was value for money over new years eve the hotel decided to charge   for the buffet in restaurant on new years eve which i felt was cashing in on the whole event they wanted to charge an extra  for view upgrade which i thought was cashing in bar very small no where to relax once a few families are in the bar 
 when we booked hotel back in jan  we requested room with a view of london eye in november had email to say our room did not have a view we could upgrade for  a night unfortunately we could not cancel booking without loosing full amount so we had no choice we were on level  and waited on average   minutes for  of  lifts really bad on arrival we were offered breakfast at an additional cost which we agreed on first morning there was a que of about  minutes for a seat in the dining room not what i would have expected for this class of hotel 
 that fact i booked a penthouse suite for new year s eve on the basis we had a view of the london eye based on the images used booking com on arrival we were advised that our room was south facing meaning we had no view of the fireworks what so ever
 there seems to be some miscommunication between this hotel and booking com we arrived on christmas day and the hotel was fully booked upon arrival it turned out that we were allocated two rooms on two separate floors even though i specifically indicated we require either a suite or two connected rooms as we have four little children i even received an email confirmation from the hotel s reservation center for this the staff at the front desk was super very nice and they did their best to solve the issue eventually they upgraded us to a penthouse at the th floor which was great the troubles continued the next day and every day thereafter as my booking for breakfast did not go through either and they had to charge me for each breakfast 
 ridiculously overpriced couldn t cont them on phone number on their website or booking com booking page staff unfriendly and unhelpful included breakfast was basic boring and cold bathroom temperature always set to very high temperature laundry facilities inadequate we re traveling g for  months there for a week and housekeeping room maintenance worse each day bed not made properly dirty cups and room service tray left in room plus rubbish would not recommend this hotel to anyone email i sent still unanswered 
 management is arrogant and unhelpfull breakfast queues of half an hour way to small restaurant for busy times prebooked and confirmed room not there reception is eager to add costs 
 our check in was delayed times as the room wasn t ready the room was small and incredibly bad value for money we have stayed in many london hotels and this is by far the worst the bar was cold due to being located by the front door breakfast was farcical after queuing to get a table on the first day we had no plates out only some cold sausages available with uncooked tomatoes and warm beans the staff seemed very disinterested in general the friends we were staying with complained and we got the grand compensation of  bottles of water from our mini bar reduced from our bill this experience also makes me question the value of using booking com as for over  per night we could have booked direct with other far better hotels 
 looks like rooms are not cleaned properly we stayed for four nights on the first evening my son unpacked a book and threw packaging under the bed which i noticed later the teared packaging has not been picked up until we were leaving and i saw it and threw away not a great evidence of cleaning service 
 overpriced hotel rude check in staff and customer relations long queue for breakfast area was too small for the amount of people bar staff put in doubles when didn t ask for them so were charged twice the price will never stay here again bvooking com need to remove this hotel from their website as it is one of the worst i have ever stayed at 
 restaurant too small for a full hotel eating breakfast we weren t prepared to wait and went elsewhere sofa bed a little uncomfortable
 my th but now final stay at the park plaza county hall what has previously been a fine hotel has descended below all expectations  night stay in a studio king family with plenty of issues  studio king is a lie there is no king bed and reception cheerfully laughed off my complaint on the first day that this was a mis representation  lifts during high occupancy average morning wait on the first floor  mins the lift simply prioritises higher floors every time yes there are stairs but with a  month pregnant wife i shouldn t have to rely on them  breakfast again during high occupancy a disgrace   mins average wait for a table  temperature control in the room does not work bedroom was a sauna whilst living area was cool  shower water pressure poor and shower head not properly cleaned with lots of outlets blocked with scum  concierge on checking out did not help with luggage from room despite request link this to pregnant wife and useless lifts after waiting  mins i had to carry luggage down stairs with multiple trips as my waiting airport transfer was charging for exceeding permitted waiting time  lobby bar is a nice area providing good value and options of f b but suffered from being too close to the entrance and so was very cold with a constant breeze from people coming and going from the hotel all in all an absolute joke yes i understand hotels struggle during high occupancy but this was simply unacceptable at the rate charged and service expectation what was my go to central london hotel is now a never again hotel 
 the windows didnt open as a result there wasnt enough fresh air into the room and all the smells were kept inside it was extremely hot and there was no way to regulate the air temperature i had to ask twice to switch the heat off at the reception the no of lifts was not enough for all the visitors nor was the no of emploees at the reseption desk room service food was low quality and very expensive our room wasnt cleaned every day and the sheets as well the sofa bed for the kids was not confortable we asked for a room in the upper floors with view but we got one in the th the hotel has   floors with no view at all 
 beds and pillows were a little hard and the glass sliding door on the toilet offered little privacy should you need it 
 we had to queue for breakfast it was worth the wait but not what we expected 
 most disappointed in the heating system as was unable to turn it up and as we would like to have done to complain at least until occasions we were to cold most of the time the air conditioning unit would only blow cold and not hot 
 it is difficult to work the heater in the room it was a cold week 
 restaurant seems to be understaffed so service was quite slow too many new employees probably due to christmas and they could not answer to questions and provide much help 
 unfortunately we did have a slight problem with the ac the thermostat would not work from the room so i had to call front desk and they would control it to be fair they did also send an electric heater to keep the room warm 
 some things were in urgent need of repair and attention such as the loose fittings on the shower unit and a corner of the bathroom false wall was breaking away 
 dining room is too small for the amount of guests we had to wait longtime before we could sit down breakfast also needs more variaton 
 no kettle in the room even though there were tea making facilities i borrowed one from my daughter in the room next door 
 that the hotel is not the one in the photos but the one across the road with a view of a wall not  
 we noticed that the front door of the hotel lets in a lot of cold air you can even feel it in the bar other than that this hotel is perfect 
 sadly there was no hot water as the boiler had broken but they were working to fix it and did give us a complimentry breakfast
 the suite was cold the heating was not working it could not be turned up in december 
 breakfast at   was disappointing i had room service and food was cold vegetarian sausages were just veg fingers and not appetising first thing in the morning i suggest quorn or cauldron sausages tomatoes not cooked and toast very pale and cold and the danish pastry was missing not enough milks sugars for day 
 the room wasn t ready at check in when we really needed a rest we were given a free drink at the bar though which went some way to compensate 
 room had not been made up when we had gone out for the day even thou we told reception we were going out for the day the bath tap shot water out from the side of the filler all over the toilet seat and up the wall the plug in the sink did not work and the shower head water came out from above the shower head it self all got fixed but not the bath filler as found this out on last night taking a bath but did report it so others staying did not have the same problem as we did 
 for a four star hotel the breakfast was not great and barely better than premier inn watery egg mass produced sausages horrible coffee and fruit juice 
 we were in a studio adjacent to the atrium whenever the elevators go up or down there s a loud clanging noise the bedroom is near the door right at the atrium it s not a continuous sound so earplugs were necessary on the second day when checking out i asked if one of the hotel staff would spend the night in our room  i believe so they could hear for themselves we got complimentary drinks because of our complaint but the first time we complained no action was taken with the extra topper mattress the bed was reasonably comfortable beware of the metal leg of the sofabed when folded out 
 booked a family room no a c heating working  small children moved room supposedly an upgrade same problem told by the manager it s because the room has a lot of glass spent the night in a cold bedroom not enough towels and poor attention to customer needs a very very disappointing stay will be writing to their head office i still had to pay 
 rainwater shower head sprayed and leaked over bathroom floor it was swimming in water and had to be mopped up with towel 
 although it was the weekend before christmas it was still a lot of money for the  night but my choice and i accept that 
 the bed just not very comfortable noise in the room at night from pipe work lifts and toilet extract which was off but you could still hear it running somewhere in the building
 dreadful wifi connection don t get a room on the corridor as the lifts are very noisy ask for a corner room
 my only downfall is that the rooms that look inside the hotel instead of outside veiw are not the good no natural sunlight cannot feel the morning
 twin room but beds joined together moved beds apart but revealed torn carpet and bare concrete bathroom fittings loose and worn breakfast expensive at   per person 
 the view from our window was over the breakfast restaurant this rendered the room windowless like a prison there was no milk and insufficient coffee for the morning brew the mini bar was locked we clearly can t be trusted then there were so many lights one of them above the mini bar we simply couldn t find the switch for so we covered it up breakfast was overpriced i know london is a tourist trap but a fixed cost is stupid why not charge a lower price for coffee and a croissant that is usually all most people want at that time of the morning 
 absolutely nothing
 we have come here previously and everything was so perfect that we even decided to stay an extra night so was slightly disappointed with this experience when checking in the staff seems very stressed and busy which made us feel in the way some of the time after waiting for   minutes to talk to the receptionist we was told we had to wait until pm just to check in so was told to come back later so me and my  month pregnant girlfriend had to walk around for an hour then return just to get into the room to relax which was the purpose of the trip when we checked in i was asked if i wanted to swipe my card to be used for room service which i did but was charged  just for doing so when i asked about this she said it was for the extras but soon found out nothing was included also we ordered two pizzas which turned up burnt and in the morning the full english breakfast we paid  for didn t even have bacon the shower door let out so much water we had to lay down towls to stop flooding in the room there are huge windows which normally would be lovely to look over london but on this occasion our view was the waterloo train station so spend most of our trip with curtains closed finally when we was getting ready to check out at   we had staff knocking at the door asking how long we could be then at   we had a very pushy woman asking how long we would be as well and with a pregnant woman it takes a while to do that and when it came to checking out we was waiting around  minutes just to do so it s very disappointing because me and my girlfriend was very much looking forward to this little get away and now i feel like iv wasted my money and should of went somewhere else i will consider returning in the future but on my trip to london it definitely won t be at this resort 
 attitude of staff the spa is hurrendows with only  lockers unisex changing facilities and sauna steam room only enough for  fully grown adults 
 the room was cold and the a c s heating did not work breakfast was boring and did not have anything extra only what is necessary you would expect a little more effort from a four star establishment also breakfast was poorly coordinated and there was always a waiting before seated 
 queuing for breakfast is not what i like breakfast not ready at   shouldn t be scrambled eggs not eatable i prefer a fresh served coffee or espresso 
 breakfast could have been a little better quite busy had to queue but they coped well pillows not quite to my taste but i am very fussy 
 breakfast area was too small and very cramped had to wait  mins to be seated no coffee or tea brought to table no cutlery on table and had to get own ordered special breakfast waited  mins and then after chasing we was told not available my wife had to have no breakfast when getting breakfast from area people bumping into you and you have to wait  minutes for eggs and ask for bacon and beans to be topped up 
 my stay there was fabulous and i don t have anything that i don t like 
 wi fi was rubbish i never got a stable connection at all dreadful musak played constantly turn it off room temperature centrally controlled so was constantly freezing it s possibly a london thing but i felt the service charging on every single thing such as the glass of wine i bought in the bar at   for ml became   even though my red was served in a white wine glass because the bar lady was cross i changed my mind to breakfast and dinner was excessive and frequently not warranted for the service received 
 there was no parking available at the hotel which isn t a huge deal but having parking is always a bonus the staff was really great and helped us find a good car park about a five minute walk away the view from our room was not great we faced waterloo station but i m sure the other side of the hotel could see the london eye the bar staff and the breakfast staff seemed a little preoccupied and we had some trouble flagging someone down but the drinks were good and pretty reasonable at the bar and the management was usually pretty good at noticing things and trying to adjust 
 over  people queuing for breakfast anticipated  minute wait got a refund really not acceptable at a modern  star hotel special birthday weekend spoiled ended up having breakfast in waterloo station 
 with only  lifts at certain times there is quite a long wait
 in my opinion there is no need to pay for breakfast the breakfast area is really small therefore leading to   min waits to eat we were lucky enough to be guided to a different serving area after waiting  min it was not worth the wait however i appreciate the kind gesture made by the staff 
 very small bed check in staff not very friendly breakfast outrageously expensive bar crowded and dirty 
 the first impression on a hotel is everything and the front of house staff are first in line to do this i should know ive worked in a hotel for  years now and worked my way up from a receptionist to a manager looking over all departments so as soon as we walk in we immediately get what feels like from all of the concierge porters and door staff that we are not welcome all by what we are wearing i know this because everytime we walked in and out of the hotel we got glares and looked up and down and asked if anybody could help us by just stepping towards the lifts they are the first impression you make on a hotel and they destroyed this for us trust me my money is just as good as the people that are walking around in a tuxedo dont judge a book by a cover it also doesnt hurt to smile im pretty sure thats what youre paid for also a massive huge thank you to the gentlemen that told us not to get a taxi to the station and get the metro we had been going one way all weekend to waterloo station but he pointed us in another direction you would trust someone in a hotel to know better than you so we turned left rather than right it wasnt sign posted where we needed to go so we got lost for mins we finally got to the station running to catch our train from london euston time we got there we missed our train by mins all thanks to a memeber of staff that cannot give directions correctly dont just point next time explain you cost me  to get home i sobbed on the platform station all i wanted to do is get home to my baby so thanks alot you can imagine how angry i was another member of staff not really giving a dam about us i was soo frustrated ive stopped myself writing a review for a few weeks hope you can take this on board and learn your staff to respect and be helpful to all that stay with you 
 the temperature of the water in the bathroom was luke warm 
 i was disappointed with the view all the pictures on the website seemed to show river views we were overlooking a rather busy waterloo station 
 we checked in early at   ish and was told to return after  pm to get our room key we left our bags and returned about pm after a busy day and was told they were still working in our room and it would be another  minutes we complained as we had to be out at  and they gave us another room but we thought this was really poor 
 i paid the room service bill before i actually was given the bill and there was a donation on the bill that would have been nice to have been asked if we wanted to contribute   i run a cleaning company and overall the place was very clean however was not dusty in the rooms and the mirrors were smeary the taps need descaling but this is me being picky given my profession i know how tight turnaround is there was only one t bag between three people and the room was kitted out for two people even though three were stopping so two glasses two cups two biscuits etc the cleaners were also trying to enter the room at   and out check out was  we inadvertently left our luggage at the wrong plaza there was no offer to collect which was our mistake but the reception lady said we could ask but the answer would be no make sure you get the right hotel 
 the sofa bed is pretty terrible and i absolutely hate the door to the bathroom it s a sliding glass door which provides very little privacy 
 i wasn t to please that i was expected to pay an extra  to watch a movie
 the air extractor in the bathroom ran all night i couldn t sleep past   the shower fittings fell apart when we reported this at check out we felt no one really cared we too had an overlong wait for breakfast 
 staff were disinterested and not helpful except the porters who were most excellent the room was cold and there is nothing in the room to control this bathrobes were very well worn and tired 
 n a
 the fact our stay was quite expensive compared to similar hotels we have stayed in in london and didn t include breakfast it would have been nice to have been checked in by a smiling receptionist making us as guests to feel welcome and special
 bigger breakfast area could be an improvement but a bit of a wait and sitting very close to other tables still didn t take away from the beautiful breakfast delicious 
 optional service charge which is added automatically on room service as well as a tray charge double recovery not what i would expect
 staff gave directions to battersea which took us on  tubes and a taxi costing us approx  and took us an hour making us late when we went to come back we discovered it was a train directly to waterloo costing  and took  minutes not impressed with poor advice 
 overall very happy with the room just the bathroom fittings were tarnished 
 i am not sure i got the room i booked as it seemed quite small for a superior double room as it was only a couple of nights however i dealt with it being woken at am on the day of check out while the do not disturb sign was on the door too wasnt great not usually this disappointed
 nothing to improve
 inside facing room was a bit claustrophobic as could not open curtains rubber undersheet on bed took off with difficulty room not serviced one of the two nights had to contact housekeeping who put it right 
 we had to ask for a fourth towel despite there being  on the booking also had to ask for more tea bags and milk in order to make one evening drink and one in the morning 
 the bathroom was awful there was a shower a bath and a hose and you got absolutely soaked trying to select the right one something needs to be done about that also the sink tap was loose and rattled around in its socket and the bath when you sat in it was really difficult to get out of as it was lower than the floor level and you needed a step ladder to get out also the photo bears no resemblance in any way shape or from to the room i was given no superior twin beds just two ordinary single beds with no gap between them at all i wont be going back there anytime soon
 having to que for breakfast i have never had to experience this before and won t stay here again for this reason 
 understandably the hotel had over  rooms that needed cleaning however we were told  minutes and the room was much longer than  minutes however that being said the room was great and the view was fantastic
 went to marriott county hall by mistake having known county hall before it became a hotel park plaza county hall is not at the old county hall although it is nearby i think it confusing to have a marriott county hall and a park plaza county hall close together although a traveller without prior knowledge would probably read the website more carefully than i did 
 seems to be good value for money but consider you will have to queue for  before to get acc s to the breakfast room never experienced this before just consider also that you will have to wait circa   every time you want take the lift basically overcrowded for the facilities offered management not present never 
 i was not very pleased with my stay with park plaza so i took time to respond on this rating i can probably say about   unlikely to return on this hotel all the while i thought i could experience  star experience it was not i was totally disappointed how dirty my room was in fact the cobwebs at the upper lampshade was still there if you look at the left side of the bedroom the carpet was very dirty the room was over decorated at its size very way off on all the  star hotels i been through for a  a night stay its very unsatisfactory and lastly the buffet was not even close to the top hotels nearby
 terrible service when the room filled with water from shower  people came after  calls not to clean but with us inside the room trying to close even beds with our clothes on them to get access to the floor tubes so  of us and  of them in a small room without even asking if they can do it just an hour before we check out getting ready for our bussiness meeting breakfast small with a tiny cooridords between tables not worthy 
 we had flood every time we showered as shower head too strong for limited space in bath and ill fitting screen no biscuits or hot chocolate in room and only one flannel left for two of us also only one chair to sit on and we are two 
 we had an issue with sofa bed in the room we were in it was broken in the centre prior to our arrival however once we informed the staff we were accommodated in another room fairly swiftly compensated for out trouble
 the room was dirty dark without view even from the th floor the service was slow we asked for an adaptor and we received one two days later every day during our four night stay we had to queue for breakfast for half an hour the breakfast room was small and we had to wait for the other residents to finish we requested a late check out before arrival as booking com gave us this option we did not receive any reply when we asked at the reception desk we were told that there was no availability unless we paid another  pounds per hour it seems that if you pay there is availability if you don t pay the hotel is fully booked 
 while it was a great idea to have guests decide whether or not to have room cleaned we would have had to give note stating this to reception by am i did not even read it until am why not let it be signed and left in the room or hung outside the door just a thought
 my only complaints are that the tv in the bedroom area was to the side and it made it hard for us both to see well the sheets seemed too small or were put on wrong and we had to rearrange them and we didn t get enough towels for the whole family we were usually in a hurry to make it to breakfast before the crowd so one child alternated shower days anyway also extra pillows would have been nice too the kids never complained about the sofa bed 
 didn t like the sofa in the lounge didn t like the little tv didn t like scaley kettle for the amount i spent expected a little bit more than a sachet of coffiee
 room size is small and dated decor no privacy in the toilet as its separated via a glass door bed size is small queuing atleast   mins for breakfast not good at all 
 the rooms are situated near kitchen which is very noisy we had to be asked to move in the middle of night because of this they did move us but the inconvenience of this was very tiring and due to this would not stay again 
 i paid extra for a city view but your over looking the train station and builders working
 the room cleaning wasn t as expected should take care of their staff and follow up on their work 
 we did not stay long enough
 when i collected my small lovely coral coloured suitcase from the concierge before leaving it was really grubby and dented 
 i hated that the bathroom didn t have a real door it was only separated by a sliding partition that didn t offer much privacy the checking in and out process was not smooth room was not ready when i was told and had to come back a couple of times before it was ready when i checked out i was given somebody else s bill i did not feel that the accommodations equaled the price i was charged 
 claustrophobic common areas and mediocre breakfast if you stay here choose a room only rate and go out for all meals there s plenty of choice nearby 
 staff are too stressed may be they are under staffed never seen so furustrated receptionist like this before we waited an exctra time to get the room which was not ready after a long journey we needed to change and kick off for a prebooked activity the delay did not help i did not expect this from such a big and pricy hotel yet the staff were a smiley as they could be not entirely bad 
 sofa bed very very uncomfortable even for the children to sleep on requested an extra duvet to put as additional mattress to try and make a little more comfortable 
 you have to wait a lot of time to have breakfast it seems the area for the breakfast was too small for the capacity of the people they sleep in this hotel there was a lot of dust in the room and especially behind the tv set the bath towels seem to be very old almost becoming gray from white too expensive
 beds could have been more comfy 
 sofa bed in family room was a bit lumpy and bumpy 
 room was nice and contemporary the bathroom sliding glass door is not practical makes too much noise when opening and closing especially in the middle of the night when others are sleeping and it is far from sound proof when showering and getting ready while others are still sleeping 
 the room was too hot despite turning the air con as low as it could go you need persistence to get room service to answer your call 
 the sofa bed was too squeaky and noisy the other bed was too soft and the rooms were too hot due to not being able open windows 
 long queue for breakfast but it was the beginning of the autumn holiday breakfast room crowded 
 breakfast far too pricey at 
 we spent over  minutes waiting for an elevator the day we were checking out they definitely need more elevators 
 everything was perfect
 breakfast had to queue for ages  minutes at least to even get a table queued right along the corridor 
 breakfast let it down a bit the food was nice but the organisation of the breakfast service could be inproved 
 long queues for breakfast and then another queue to get fruit and toast we had to join the same queue for people wanting cooked breakfast restaurant to small for the amount of guests low water pressure on th floor took ages to run a bath and the plug leaked and water was not hot always normally use premier inn and wanted to make this visit special v disappointed
 the bathroom smelt of damp drains room  no signal on ee within my room and wifi kept cutting out on my iphone 
 staff lack warmth all very brusque housekeeping woke us too early with insistent banging on our door repeated  minutes later i printed our boarding cards at guest computer in basement keyboard needs replacement characters almost completely faded and illegible
 temperature control was difficult and bedding was too warm with no alternatives restaurant was expensive and meals a bit disappointing but plenty of alternatives nearby 
 the room was quite cold even with ac turned up to max there was no heating as such just a cool breeze coming out of the vents that coupled with mostly tile flooring made it a chilly stay 
 room view had windows that don t open as the view is within looking over the restraunts very unusual and no fresh air
 rooms were a bit small but all we needed we were hardly in them except to sleep 
 for the money that we paid there was no swimming pool and the beds were really uncomfortable it was like sleeping on a camping bed i found that beds in a premier inn were a lot more comfortable 
 room was pokey odd sounds from water heating pipe work that sounded like a dog room was cold we ended up switching the a c off one pillow each not two and bed wasn t as good as a premier inn
 service at the restaurant for dinner was slow but it s only a small criticism 
 the room was small and hot and the a c was noisy and ineffective little space to relax certainly not possible to enjoy a comfortable breakfast we should have booked the park plaza westminster bridge which has a better atmosphere
 room size for single occupancy was just too tiny i could hardly fit in  bags no view atall tv channels were vintage too with no music channel even a basic movie channel and all was paid 
 it took ages for us to be able to check out the staff at the checkout desk were oblivious to which customers were next in the queue due to there not being a queue system set up my husband i were waiting patiently for a long time for the  or  staff members to serve their customers when a rude man another customer went in front of us soon as a staff member was free she didn t say anything like sorry these customers were in front of you so we had to wait another half an hour it was far too slow 
 nothing to complain about
 the room is kimd of narrow so there is limited space to put  luggage in and able to fully open them 
 it was needed to ask for  hours late checkout i was unwell and outside was a heavy rain weather i thought that they will contact with me to confirm or reject my request i spent a lot of money during my stay i was just asking for  hours for free the staff did not call me i thought that they are accepting my request in fact they by themselves cut the money and took some extra money as donation from my accounts with unauthorised way which were impolite and very bad behaviours i was perhaps going to cancel my request or extend one night instead of cut more money for just  hours it looked like stolen issue therefore i really would like to refund my money the supervisor did not care i confirmed to her that i will complain she was laughing and showed me her name on her t shirt as a kind of the confrontation 
 stayed in an accessible family room my husband and i had to sleep on the sofa bed mattress extremely thin and uncomfortable this was really disappointing and effected our impression of the hotel room overall we expected much better quality for the price charged 
 immediate payment request for room service majority of hotels accept signature on delivery receipt 
 i have stayed several times at park plaza hotels in this exact area their are three within several hundred feet this being my first time at park plaza country hall i expected the same gold standard that i have experienced at the other hotels i was staying in the penthouse on the top floor for the weekend which means i expect penthouse level customer service i had several issues with house cleaning security and most significant of all was the decor in the penthouse the penthouse has an amazing view of big ben parliament and london eye the decor is staggeringly outdated and resembles a  s era theme room which is not what i believe they purposely set out to do all of this really soured my experience at a hotel chain that i exclusively choose to utilize when i am in london this experience may deter me from using this specific hotel during any future trips to london that being said i reached out to hotel management about my experience and they showed great concern which is in the what did you like section please read 
 can t think of anything we didn t like 
 requested a quiet room in advance and this was confirmed at reception unfortunately our room was on a gallery and overlooked the lift area from which banging occurred at night and day but not so noticeable then the noise seemed to be produced by the counter weights on the glass fronted lifts apart from this very annoying interruption to our sleep everything else was good have stayed here previously but not in this area of the hotel 
 nothing an ideal venue for our visit 
 there was nothing i could complain about
 every time you enter the hotel you have to show your key to make sure you are a resident of the hotel but they need to fix their attitude while asking instead making you feel as you are a intruder want to enter the hotel in addition time of check out they staff didn t help in taking the luggage from the reception to the car they asked me to ask the driver and that it s not their job to do so this single incident made me think twice to come back to this hotel or not other than that everything was good
 everything was great we had a fantastic time 
 reception was a not efficient i tried to pay for the length of my stay upon checking in but the reception was adamant that i pay the first night i told her that it was better if i do only one transaction on my card but she won t have any of it but after we have done the transaction on the card she asked me if i want to pay the rest of my stay so i thought that was really bizarre she wasn t friendly at all and just get on with what she was doing came down the following day to pay for the rest of my stay and no greetings only after the transaction she remembered that she ought to ask if my stay was so far any good 
 reservation process for family was a mess moved to a room in front of the elevators breakfast was always full and had a long waiting queue to get a table 
 the breakfast was on the expensive side for what you get 
 eggs at breakfast tasted like powdered eggs and the mushrooms were tinned 
 the breakfast could have been priced lower it was a little on the expensive side 
 the bathroom shower drain produced random flapping noises through the night room  the bathroom was grubby around the corners of the shower and floor the air con was noisy and the room was very stuffy with it off because we paid by debit card the room fridge was locked so any milk we brought to the room could not be kept cold very limited clothing stowage no draws of any good size the hanging space was limited due to the ironing board spare quilts and pillows ok once they were taken out the safe was just above floor level so on your hands and knees to open it and lock it 
 pounds were charged in case of extras at the moment of checking in and i do not remember having been properly informed 
 temperature control in the room was not very good just a knob with no temperature feedback hard to get it right as there was quite a delay in the change
 this hotel does not have parking bay and it makes it difficult to get dropped off or take a taxi we stayed in a family studio and found a sofabed too soft the rooms at park plaza westminster bridge opposite were more spacious and more comfortable 
 there was nothing to dislike 
 only down side was our view from the room as we was looking out over the old euro tunnel station but nothing the hotel could do about this and didn t want to move room as our room  was really nice 
 we had to call housekeeping due to stain covered bedsheets for sofa bed which stank took half an hour before anybody came and replaced didn t help put new sheets on kids were shattered so didn t help matters staff seemed unhelpful was this due to not wanting extras 
 room good have been a bit bigger breakfast room a bit crowded on weekends
 i had asked at time of booking that the room be feather free especially bedding as feathers trigger my husband s asthma this was not done and so we had to ask again at reception and then wait for someone to swap the bedding overall staff seemed too busy 
 n a
 bathroom had a smell which we tried to mask with perfume also didn t like the frosted glass doors on the bathroom 
 would have liked breakfast to be included in our room price or at least be a little cheaper 
 no fresh air no ability to open any kind of window it was very warm on our stay and it felt claustrophobic i appreciate we were on a high floor but maybe a smaller window that would allow some fresh air in would have been good 
 the cooked breakfast wasn t as good as i expected the eggs didn t taste like eggs and the mushrooms should always be fresh and not tinned the toast machine wasn t working either 
 as above but rest ok room small but it is in central london
 i never get a respond to my email asking for early check in which they didn t accept at the hotel which ruined my first day in london after such a long flight the wifi is very bad you barely can browse or send text messages 
 elevators were kind of small and slow and for some reason many people were riding them up and back down again for no apparent reason they are glass but the view is only the inside atrium making them crowded 
 small room the desk chair did not pull out all the way from under the desk mattress needed to be replaced i m used to having a flat sheet in between me and the comforter no wash cloths in bathroom 
 bathroom let the suite down as it didn t look up to standard compared to the rest of the suite taps and shower looked as if it needed cleaning with a goodlime scale remover 
 there was nothing i didnt like about the hotel but maybe instead of red wine maybe a bottle of schloer or some other sparkling grape juice but i didnt mind becaus ei know i didnt put that in my notes so staff would not of known but again no complaints i was just as happy with that thought 
 the bathroom had a seperate door for shower which was not able to close completely and before we realized the entire room was flooded 
 i prefer to include breakfast in the hotel rate i paid to be more competitive with other hotels in the same class 
 the rooms were never made up until later afternoon despite us taking off any private signs on the door it was just too late to clean the room and the breakfast room is too small for the size of the hotel we had to wait way too long to get a table 
 we asked the reception to please pick up the laundry we left in our room and placed inside the bag in the morning before we left the hotel however when we got back later in the evening it was not picked up 
 didn t get into room until pm and that was only because of me complaining dirty sheets no toilet roll asked for more when came back just thrown in bathroom this is just half of it
 for the cost the rooms are small compared to north america but bigger here than what you will find at hotels elsewhere staff were exceptional 
 drinks a little expensive but that s london bar staff lovely though 
 breakfast room was quite small and and was some waiting for a table but if gone earlier probably wouldn t have been a problem 
 our door keys did not work after the first attempt the technician had to come and change the battery which delayed our trip out for nearly half an hour 
 we were put in a room at the back of the hotel overlooking the train station just near the cleaning room which we heard a slamming door all night we changed room with an upgrade which was still at the back of the hotel and same room our friend checked in the same night and asked for an upgrade at check in and she got the best view 
 we shared a room with my brother who was visiting and the hotel provided a pull out sofa bed that was fine unfortunately the pullout bed was near the window and the regular bed was nearest the door my wife and i slept on the pullout bed just because of the access to windows and natural light i thought that the main bed should be closest to the window instead of the sitting area pullout bed seemed like a bad layout plan the pullout bed was tolerable but we cannot comment on the main bed because we didn t sleep on it 
 was a bit disappointed there wasn t a cafe or bar in the upper area of the hotel for all of the guests to make the most of the view it would have provided as i thought i d read there was but other than that nothing from our point of view 
 offering a discount  if booking in restaurant then finding out on bill it s only on food and you add   service charge without asking i always tip myself and hate automatic service charging breakfast a little chaotic but good value 
 n a
 parts of the breakfast buffet were low quality one room had no natural light which i would expect for a room labeled superior rooms very small 
 paying  for  night for an extra city view room which is a view of the hotel across the road squashed breakfast tinned food not enough seats outside to tables faulty equipment room not cleaned properly not actually in county hall doors not fitted properly and no milk for a hot drink completely spoilt our th wedding anniversary and still no contact apology from anyone at park plaza appalling standards for an hotel which won an award 
 no cooking stove 
 at check in they hadn t realised  adults and  kids so didn t have sofa bed ready couldn t understand as email clearly stated number of guests breakfast very busy but manageable 
 the view over waterloo station it is appreciated that this is unavoidable for a number of rooms but actually i might have paid a little more for a room with a better view 
 breakfast was disappointing
 we had a family of  with sofa bed and that s the worse bed i have ever slept on there is a huge gap in the thin mattress and i somehow got through the night by putting some towels to fill it up the checkin took a very long time and the room was not ready by the time since they couldn t predict the time we decided to walk out for site seeing although we were tired after a long flight 
 absolutely nothing we will return 
 the breakfast was not good taking a run of the mill buffet breakfast and turning in to something special is not complicated and creates a memorable moment that the hotel could be famous for at the moment processed scrabbled eggs cardboard bacon and over baked rolls are not the way forward unfortunately the pineapple juice had turned and was undrinakable having said all of that the staff were nice 
 breakfast was chaotic queues very long waited over half an hour one of the days were we there restaurant area is cramped and people are seated too close to each other so no privacy for a conversation no where to sit in the reception area not exactly wheelchair accessible photos are deceptive as the hotel isn t as close to the london eye as the photos make out 
 poor breakfast extra charge for the omelet which is unacceptable big queues very day after   for breakfast because the restaurant was extra small and you had to wait long for taking the lifts
 the staff were all friendly however i was shoked the room was so dusty everywhere even the tables and i have kids with me i think they should take care about the cleaning part because it is the most important thing the key card for the room was not working well everytime we had to get in and we had to call the reception for fixing it also most important channels in the tv were not working and there is no looby as far as i noticed also we had a late check in at  pm on the arrival date 
 our view was just another hotel across the street careful when booking the photos seem to give the impression it is the hotel at the end of westminster bridge but that another from the same company can sometimes be a   minute wait for breakfast table as dining area is too small for such a large hotel 
 the second bed in the suite room was very uncomfortable we had to wait for breakfast every day because the hotel was crowed and the dining room was not big enough
 bar prices were a bit costly but had to take this in to consideration as we were in the center of london
 the bed was too soft for us and nappy changing area not sign posted in the last cubicle in the female wc down stairs also should be in an area where dad can do nappy changes 
 room smelled of drains sofa bed not made up insufficient number towels toiletries for a family of three no tea coffee etc available in room breakfast long queue hot food cold no eggs could not have breakfast in mezzanine designated area insufficient capacity to accomodate volume of guests so served in a conference room not prepared 
 i chose the hotel as it stated that it has an indoor pool the spa was good but i was expecting a pool 
 the rooms advertised as having city views were a little misleading as to view any of the city you had to press your head up against the window to look between the  buildings opposite although you could then see big ben
 not a clean hotel or clean room wardrobes and cupboards covered in marks and stains glass in lifts covered in smears dust and stains as were the glass balustrades within the hotel rooms aren t soundproof as room next door had a baby in room which we could hear crying bar and restaurant food not worth the money 
 breakfast main lounge was overcrowded at  am so had to use upstairs dining area then there was a mix up over our pre booked breakfast which had to be sorted however after that all fine 
 more toiletries
 we were very happy and have no complaints
 sofa bed had a metal bar that was very uncomfortable the shower only had hot water no matter how many attempts we made no pool 
 i think just a personal thing but i did not like the rooms as they did not have a window to the outside just the interior and thus they were dark the room itself was nicely laid out and the bed was very comfortable 
 the breakfast wasn t warm enough tasteless mushrooms and scrambled eggs could be better 
 i was completely disappointed and mad since the reception staff are generally unfriendly more specifically brad brad not only he talks to guests with an attitude and from an upper position he always thinks he is right without notification to me or alignment with me he deducted the whole amount of the stay from my credit card instead of preauthorization he claimed that this is the hotel policy to deduct the whole amount if the stay is more than  nights i told him i was not aware of such policy and asked him to show me where it is written he said it is not written anywhere and the hotel is not supposed to show the guests all the policies i told him i disagree especially if it is related to terms and payments i asked to speak to his manager he said i am the manager then i asked to speak to his superior then he said i will cancel the sales and preauthoriz again the amount i told him this will not work as it will take at least  days to reverse the payment he said that he is sure it will take few hours unfortunately he cancelled it and took  working days during this period the amount he deducted was stuck between banks and the hotel keeps trying to preauthoriz the amount and notifications from my bank keeps coming to my phone with failed attempted of course those attempts hurt my credit records with the bank i was devastated and angry but no one said sorry and no compensation were provided to me horrible customer experience 
 had to move room due to an infestation of ants on arriving home and checking the bank we were overcharged by  for our stay hotel also said we used the mini bar when we didnt not happy 
 free wifi only mbit but upgrade to mbit just gbp per day why so complicated no balcony
 the open area with the glass just waist high was scary with young kids
 overall for the cost of the stay i thought the food could have been better only had breakfast and it was not great cleanliness could have been better location not great 
 stepping out of the bath almost required a ladder 
 mold around the bath inwards window so people from the lifts and on the otherside of the walkway could see straight in your room and there was no daylight in the room no mirror in bedroom
 waited past  for our room key and little extras tokens for the kids were not received until alot later after i enquired about them this was of course after we had our evening meal small problems no major ones on the whole a pleasurable experience 
 long wait for a lift
 room over an hour late and staff not my problem attitude
 great location dinner in the restaurant was delicious housekeeping staff were amazing did a really thorough job breakfast waiting staff very attentive in difficult and sometimes chaotic working conditions great views from the room
 it would have been great if there was a pool or even the option to use the pool in the park plaza just across the road i was disappointed that they no longer have an executive suite it is still mentioned on the website so i had kind of expected it with the room we booked the beds could have been more comfortable but maybe they are just a bit old 
 bit expensive for food and drink were told we were upgraded but the room was as last visit kids were at the rear view not at the front
 nothing of note
 restaurant staff seemed more interested in talking to each other than serving guests then a little snappy when we asked another server for help
 i ordered  burgers for d kids on saturday as we were meeting my niece and boyfriend for dinner and d kids were hungry and wanted to eat straight away so i asked for  plain burgers with nothing only the bun i informed them they were fussy eaters and wanted nothing more i was asked would i like chips and i said i portion of chips i got the  burgers with just the bun with loads of salad and garnish on the side and one portion of chips and was charged over  pounds for this included in that were two teas i think it was a ridiculous price to be charged for two burgers when i looked at the menu afterwards i guess they gave me the burger on the menu which was   each it says on the menu there was a kids menu and the waiters knew they were for kids i think it was a ridiculous price and we didn t eat anymore there after that to me it was a big disappointment 
 nothing
 the view was a big disappointment paid a lot of money for a suite and double room to have a fantastic view for one night it was a very ho hum view over industry and train station yard bathrooms were just ok with sliding door and smallish 
 the room was overpriced the bathroom was cramped the place lacks decor and warmth lifts too slow and crowded overall not a great stay 
 the room is starting to look slightly tired reception was noisy and not particularly attractive didn t bother visiting restaurant because of this 
 very noisey place and we were woken up each morning early by the cleaners we did not sleep very well in the two nights we stayed 
 i didn t like extra charge from my visa i discussed with them they said your write we going to return back till now many days not refunded i complain but nothing done
 no smell in the first place and a warmer room but as stated both were resolved quickly
 queue at breakfast time a bit annoying needs a bigger restaurant room for  people is very small and cramped but guess one has to live with that 
 don t have breakfast in the overflow room food tasted like it had been cooked for hours and wasn t hot 
 the shower was terrible difficult to operate and just a teickle of water hard to get into due to the height of the bath 
 bed not particularly comfortable had a topper and extra under sheet neither of which fitted and stayed put during the night 
 the quilt in our room was a bit too thick which made us sweating even we had turned down the room temperature to very low 
 not mad on an internal facing room i like natural light and it felt a little claustrophobic but that s me 
 there was obviously a drainage problem in the bathroom so the room smelled terrible i wished i d complained earlier as when i did complain it was too late for the hotel to do anything about it and they didn t seem too bothered about it either the hotel is pretty tired and the staff weren t very friendly either not the best experience we have had 
 not enough dining space for breakfast limited fried eggs one per person room on second floor overlooking another hotel room in the front despite of paying premium price 
 no window for natural light room was internal and the air con was very cold even when altered or the room became very hot without 
 breakfast is over priced for what it is worth and flow of busy times are not managed well due to lack of staff at least a complimentary bottle of water should be offered with room for the price of one night 
 nothing i didn t like well done
 very unhelpful and unfriendly and unflexible managment we wanted to change the room we booked in the beginning because no one mentioned the room we booked does not fit the guest amount however they were complicating it 
 bar breakfast we had to wait mn in the queue cool system flowing on the ground family room too small tv couldn t be seen totally from the bed i will never recommend
 chaotic concierge could not handle the volume of luggage arriving overcrowded breakfast room breakfast was an uncomfortable experience insufficient lift capacity long queues for lifts at times
 the restaurant of breakfast was too small for huge hotel we should to wait about   min to set in a table the value of money was over to this hotel 
 the tv was a bit small and the sofa bed was really hard but our son didn t seem to mind 
 restaurant too small to cope with numbers at breakfast hotel advertises rooms with views of london but our room faced inwards ie no view 
 the beds and pillows are not comfortable and under the sofa bed was not cleaned plastic bags and crackers and the shower box not cleaned well and a bit broken 
 the minibar was well stocked but the prices are unfairly high make the price of drinks reasonable so the customers won t have to purchase the items from an outside source also water runs on the bathroom floor after taking a shower nothing a couple of towels won t fix though 
 just some information about how to use the transport taxi buses underground and parking and also remind to pay the congestion charge
 needed a curtain between bedroom and sitting areas budget toilet roll 
 the sausages were a little bit pale looking for my liking and the restaurant got very busy at breakfast with several people queuing but luckily we got down early enough to avoid the wait 
 the restuarant was good however they did not have non dairy milk to cater for those with lactose intolerance or vegans would have loved to have either soya or almond milk 
 very busy hotel breakfast room crowded and noisy inconsistent housekeeping in terms of towels left etc but this was remedied immediately 
 i guess maybe a fan in the room ac works great im just not used to the humidity 
 the bedroom soundproffing was really poor as we could hear the client of the next room snoring at night 
 check in could be quicker we were lost and ended up at the wrong park plaza hotel and queued for check in and were then redirected and queued again 
 the bathroom could have been a little bit more private a almost see through glass door is not appropriate for everyone and it s not sound isolated either 
 didn t like the restaurant as tables were too close together and the pillows on the bed were very soft 
 no extra pillows available on request king size bed was a small king air conditioning was not working properly on a hot day and no windows to open 
 one lift was out of action for the whole of our stay quite long waits 
 the lady cleaning the spa could ve been abit less snappy moany but apart from that it was all good 
 extra bed very uncomfortable the mattress was far too thin air conditioning completely inadequate 
 dining area was very cramped during peak breakfast time with little room to move between tables when going to the buffet area 
 the fold out couch had dirty used tissues in it and it was extremely uncomfortable the double bed was also very uncomfortable overall just not worth the money 
 the bedroom was comfortable but didn t like the window overlooking the atrium bathroom was a wet room which flooded all the floor when the shower was used not ideal fittings in bathroom tired old and some broken towels old and grey only stayed  nights would not have liked to have stayed longer expected better from the rate which is charged 
 the breakfast area and food was very poor for a four star hotel it was all selfserving so the cooked breakfast was luke warm where u eat had s caffeine feel about it this is very poor for the money
 requested high room with view affirmed that this could happen but asked to wait half hour while room prepared two hours later and repeated visits to reception to check room was finally available no view when querying this was told that no twin rooms had views of london eye should have been told this in first place and would have not had yo wait for room diasspointing sevice beware 
 being ripped off because of the conference that was being held there not paid for by corporate but charged same inflated price isn t fair in ordinary holiday or leisure customers
 unprofessionalism untrained staff getting authorisation from my guests s cards without prior notice drinks served in dirty glasses in the restaurant 
 the room did not smell nice the view from the room was the worst we ve ever had 
 the drain in the bathroom had an unpleasant smell
 nothing it was perfect 
 everything was great at the hotel until breakfast which was a shambles long line of people waiting to be seated tried to push  of us on a very small table for  and did not like it when we refused to be seated until they found a table for  people 
 concierge is very week they said they made a booking for airport taxi for me by the time arrived they said no taxi 
 couple of negatives no hd on tv and breakfast area was busy and a bit open for my taste 
 despite being a superior twin room the room was so small that the beds were pushed together like a double bed the hallway was being decorated on our floor which meant decorating sheets and paint smells although they did seem to finish in just one day 
 the house keeping can be improved the staff forgot to replenish the tea and coffe amenities frequently 
 can t think of anything 
 the breakfast is exactly the same each day which can get a little boring a lil variety would go a long way
 dust in tv table that accompanied us througout our stay not renewing some amenities daily room service is expensive given the quality and quantity of the food 
 breakfast slightly pricy but not overly so 
 the price it is expensive but you definatley get what you pay for here its perfect
 drinks in the hotel bar were far too expensive bought  basic drinks at over   meant that no more drinks in what was such a beautiful hotel bar no vfm
 nothing really had to ask for bathrobes but these were instantly provided so not a problem 
 the room was ridiculously small impossible to pull chair out from the desk as the bed was so close not a choice for business travellers
 was nothing not to like excellent hotel and staff
 shower over bath with only half glass screen floor was very wet after each shower lost internet during power cut 
 being woken at am by a wake up call i did not order being woken ten minutes later by a phone call then the teenagers next door slammed the door numerous times from am to  am until i asked them to stop the manager on duty was not helpful and advised that i was not the only one woken up by the automated wake up call system he advised that at least  other guests were also called that did not make me feel better and there was no effort to mitigate my dissatisfaction 
 bathroom smelled like a sewer rooms were very small and cramped pull out couch in the suite was very uncomfortable breakfast buffet was chaotic and poor quality
 pricey but i suppose it is london one small point used the bath and although there was no visible dirt in it when i got in it was obvious that it hadn t been cleaned since the last person had used it 
 hotel too old definitely need a renovation smelly drainage problem and rusty toilet utilities dark room smaller than what the photos shown noisy refrigerators changed the room twice and waste a lot of my time without any compensation not even a late check out for free the staff is helpful but seems they are adapted to the complains i doubt these problems are usual 
 a little on the expensive side but you get what you pay for and hey that s london 
 one of the  tv s in the room was not working would have been nice if it was other than all was great 
 although we had an upgrade the bed was situated by the entry door and the view over looked waterloo station with the shard way in the distance having stayed at park plaza before the scenic view wasn t as good as what we ve experienced in the past i e the london eye despite this we still had a pleasant stay and i would recommend the park plaza county hall 
 bed was a bit on the soft side 
 customer service was very poor no bedding for my children had to wait at pm for housekeeping to come and make the bed after e mailing to ask for a fan and told one would be in room we had to make about  phone calls to het one no managers on to discuss situation sunday and now it appears they have overcharged me
 the sofa bed for the children was really uncomfortable i ended up sleeping on it with one of the children as they wouldn t settle 
 up on check out i was inform that they didn t charge anything to my credit card i was asked to pay by cash i paid my bill including room charge by cash over  pounds they have charged  upon arrival to my credit card and another  on checkout i have inform my bank and waiting for the answer i will file this to court this was really disappointing 
 we had to pay full price for breakfast even though my wife just had  rounds of toast and a pot of tea 
 would have liked a more varied menu for our evening meal all italian 
 breakfast was too expensive need some eat and run options as our tours left early each morning or even a sack lunch we could purchase 
 i found the bathroom a little clinical reminded me of a stay in hospital room service food could be better 
 i would have been annoyed with the view given had i had to pay full price as looking into the atrium was fine for the cost and duration of my stay any longer at full price i would have not been happy 
 internet speed of mb apparently i didn t test it as my data plan runs faster but there was no milk supplied for my tea a true travesty 
 we didn t have cold water coming out of the taps in our room due to mixer taps passing wasn t worth complaining about as we only was there another day so just bought a couple of bottles of water to drink and brush our teeth with
 minor detail that i am a vegetarian and found the scrambled eggs too creamy it would be nice to have more egg than cream the hot chocolate was not proper hot chocolate either but again a minor observation 
 the prices are high but really this is too be expected within this area of london 
 issues with media and tv wifi could be better and for the price should be free for the best connection 
 we had a meal for  people in the italian restaurant sadly the meal wasn t to a very good standard my main course was not cooked properly i did complain to be told that red bloody chicken was a normal way to serve baby chicken a lot of money for a meal that left  men still hungry over priced a complete let down 
 we arrived at   and it would of been nice to freshen up from our long journey but we could not get in the room until after pm 
 parking next door too small tight
 if i was being very picky then the only thing is i would have preferred a soft close toilet seat only because i have one and out of habit i kept letting the seat slam down 
 had to pay for items in the fridge shouldn t have to when your paying so much 
 we had a kitchenette some more bench space would have been nice the microwave took all the bench 
 we were charged for something we did not consume but after several emails with their staff it was reversed so all good 
 nothing 
 stiff and short bed sttiff sofa long dark hair in our bed sloppy scrambled egg dirty cutlery bottled bleached tap water warm friut juice with a glass no bigger than a thumb
 nothing it would be better if the price could be reduced 
 called to request early check in and was advised i needed to book an additional night night before to guarantee this was ridiculous as i only wanted to check in an hour or so earlier than the pm time stated i declined this and turned up at  pm and was told the room wont be ready until  i felt this was unreasonable as i offered to pay for early check in as it was my sons birthday which is why we was staying at the hotel we wont be staying again 
 it took a while in the lifts to get to and from room bar area was a little small considering hotel was child friendly childs menu was not much choice the breakfast was very poor coffee tasted like the cheapest coffee you could buy not much room in breakfast restaurant or in the bar definitely not worth the money we paid
 i paid in advance on arrival and was disappointed that i was not advised that i could not charge our meal to the room would have been better if i had been asked if i wanted the facility to charge to the room although not a major problem the message light on the phone continued flashing all night although there were no messages we couldn t get it to turn off so just moved the phone so it wasn t annoying 
 couldn t turn off the rather noisy air con in the living room terrace could do with some outdoor seating and a table disliked the sliding glass door to the bathroom 
 sofa bed was uncomfortable according to the person who slept in it mattress was too thin and frame could be felt through the mattress 
 my room was a bit hot and i couldn t regulate it but my daughters was fine 
 view from room overlooking bins and graffiti room service didn t understand our request and we finished up with  plates so shortcake and paid nearly  for the privilege 
 the room was very warm due to the design and not being able to open windows air con too noisy to have on all night to cool it down
 duvet had holes in it and it was all stained curtains were dirty cleaner didn t speak english so got confused when i asked her to clean the room the extra bed was very uncomfortable 
 bed needs changing you ll still have a good night sleep on it but i would suggest changing it soon otherwise you cant complain really 
   service charge added to everything including drinks in the bar our room had a small kitchen area with sink towel and washing up liquid provided so a cloth would have been a good idea 
 the parking in the area was poor and the food was a bit on the pricey side 
 room service wasn t cheap and the tray charge and service charge hike the bill but it is clearly stated in the menu 
 the aircon was terrible and there was no key to open the door room was so hot and stuffy which effected our sleep 
 the tv were a bit small i think movies should be free and the internet should free as well even more than mg other than that everything was great thank you mr daniel for the best hospitality 
 we arrived at  pm but room wasn t ready was given complimentary drinks while we waited we waited for  minutes kitchenette tap and sink tap in the bathroom leaked the sofa bed was old and uncomfortable to sleep on and water could be heard coming down the pipes behind the bathroom throughout the night the wifi was very slow 
 reception staff poor on arrival it was  at night and i just wanted sorted and into bed they wanted me to pay  up front for minibar and bar reception on check out first clasd
 supposed upgrade to a studio when we had booked a twin bed settee was very very uncomfortable breakfast was reasonable location was good staff were friendly 
  price it s expensive about the room size and facilities sofa bed it s brok tv chanel it s pooring and few if you want see move through tv you must paid for that price 
 check in was a little chaotic but provision of cold drinks was a welcoming touch when check in time is  o clock you expect your accomodation to be ready at two however a complimentary drink at the bar was readily given by the apologetic reception staff 
 one lift was out of order not a massive problem but it did take some time to travel up to floor 
 name suggests the hotel is part of the old county hall glc building which it is not but it is a  minute walk away and dont let that put you off 
 at  at night are bathroom ended up flooded because of a drain issue somehow the cleaning staff managed to overlook a plastic cup clogging the drain my belief is then that there s no way they cleaned the shower before we arrived absolutely disgusting 
 the beds weren t very comfy and the pillows were practically non existent 
 the bathroom door jammed but no one s fault really 
 too expensive room at times too hot no pool or sitting room to read kitchenette fridge too small and no toaster sofa uncomfortable
 the size of the room too small bedding too hot no top sheet so couldn t throw the quilt back although there was a room temperature control but this was a bit noisy 
 room wasn t that clean cup marks on tables everything a little worn some grime in bathroom hotel felt rather crowded especially the reception area lifts were slow
 woken in early hours by wailing of the plumbing from room above next door horrible noise and ruined my attempt to catch up on a precious bit of sleep gave feedback on checkout they promised to investigate and fix but that doesn t help me much 
 a bit more information about complimentary upgrade we did not really need a studio and would simply have preferred a largish comfortable room
 with the room upgrade nothing at all could have been better 
 big sliding glass door on bathroom was noisy and kept popping out of it s runner small complaint really didn t alter enjoyment of stay 
 nothing the people whole place is absolutely perfect don t go anywhere else and no i don t work for them 
 had a change of plans and couldn t cancel an unwanted night but think that was because the booking was made through booking com
 old air conditioning doesn t work i put that on the coldest and still didn t worked bathroom water system very old it made a bad noise when we were there no place to drop off and pick up 
 the shower hot water didn t get warmer than tepid had to boil a few kettles of warm to make a warm bath 
 the aircon wasn t working in our room on the hottest day of the year we called twice for it to be sorted and no one came or bothered to call i complained at check out and the staff didn t seem bothered not impressed at all 
 regular attempts by staff to enter my room also breakfast venue was full of young children creating a chaotic environment 
 the tv should be relocated away from the desk as it s uncomfortable watching from a less than a metre away and get a bigger screen 
 my room was given to other guests when they checked in i was out but my clothes etc where clear to be seen when i spoke to the reception the response was i am night staff so i don t know anything this was a surprisingly unhelpful and unsatisfactory response i also had to phone  times for someone to open my safe before the v pleasant gentleman arrived 
 room not as described on hotel website poor service from staff plastic rubber sheets over mattress made the bed uncomfortable house keeping staff knocking on the door early in the morning on a bank holiday 
 couldn t open my balcony door bed was far to soft and uncomfortable mattress needs replacing breakfast was plentiful but the ingredients were cheap this impacted on the taste which was not good at all eggs tasted powered sausages tasted like they had been cooked the day before bacon had absolutely no flavour cereals tasted old and we re obviously the cheaper brands orange juice was out of a long life carton i m sure it s a shame the hotel obviously try s to save money on the breakfast as this is a guests last memory of the property and it s not good i was not the only guest unhappy with it judging by the guarded whispers heard at the breakfast table 
 room was small and not very clean the bathroom door had stains on it room was very cold and it took a while to get it to normal temperature the shower handle was leaking 
 the cost for breakfast on a per person basis was a good  above availability nearby 
 nothing
 the wifi was working but it could have been a bit faster but it wasn t a big issue 
 no cold fridge had to use mini bar and ice from ice machine had a pizza in the restaurant not very nice
 came back after running marathon no room to sit in very small downstairs bar unable to get snack and drink should have opened upstairs restaurant to accommodate everyone eve before no proper menu in restaurant just a buffet which did not look very good 
 bigger kitchenette and fridge bedroom which could be closed off 
 we ate in the italian restaurant on friday evening our waitress was exceptional but this was were our experience ended the food was truly atrocious my husbands spaghetti bolognese went back twice but was still luke warm my steak was below average and how a kitchen can not cook chips so that they are not rock hard is beyond belief such a shame 
 just the cost of drinking in the hotel bar is the major downfall of this and to be fair most hotels 
 room had no milk for coffee n hot chocolate sachets had no dressing gowns n complementary water
 expected a bigger room for the price room had arrangements for tea and coffee but no cups mugs no dentalkit vanity kit in the rooms these are basic things expected in a room especially for the price paid and considering it is a  star hotel 
 bed was uncomfortable no robe and slippers room service drinks were expensive and served in the most tiny glasses water should be in the room on arrival some biscuits with the tea facilities would be a nice touch toast was cold pizza was substandard shower can be scorching no need to have a gauge that can raise the temperature to such a dangerous level
 bed is not comfortable as well as the sofa bed low quality pillows small electronic fredge mini bar auto charge on moving stuff 
 i prefer wooden floors and windows that open so hard to find in the uk the light inside the closet wouldn t go off no matter how firmly i closed it which was annoying as it was right beside the bed 
 i had a room to the inner side w o a real window the price is rather high 
 i had requested for early check in inspire of positve email earlier the check in staff declined me early check in this was very disappointing also being a club carlson member did notbenefit me in getting an upgrade or better response 
 the sofa bed
 the bathroom had a smell of drains the whole time we were there if we left the bathroom door open then the whole room stank informed reception who were very apologetic also we arrived at the restaurant at pm and were told we couldn t use it as they had a booking of  people due it didn t look too busy as there were plenty of empty tables but we were told we had to use the bar instead so we went elsewhere 
 very limited in room tea and refreshments no bottled water etc a bigger fridge would be helpful for families sofa bed mattress was very hard but slept ok though 
 really could not fault the place
 hotel needs more than location to be good hire better staff worst hotel ever i had booked penthouse suite for  night i would never ever use park plaza brand anywhere in the world park plaza county hall should be a case study on how to lose customers check in early check in request was met with callous attitude the front desk seemed to enjoy the ordeal seeing us in distress of red eye from washington with an ill family member all the front desk members were doings were enjoying my frustration asked me to come back at pm as the policy stated i walked in exactly at pm guess what room wasn t ready excuses and stories followed i didn t expect early check as a right but  problems  attitude of staff  weren t ready with room even as per written policy they played usual practice of offering me free breakfast which i refused and did not use room poor and dated furnishing cheap furniture wardrobe doors did not close air condition thermostat buttons don t work for setting the desired temperature you have to call the desk and tell them and they set it from maintenance room somewhere room was freezing again at night causing my family members sickness grow bad and no one could sleep silver lining checkout was smooth with nice staff manager intervened during check in and tried to damage control sounded more constrictive and sensitive hotel needs to hire such people everywhere 
 poor bathroom shower leaked all over the place and poor control of water flow no where to hang towels or bathrobes one bedside light didn t work what is it about hotels in this category where there s no mirror above the dressing table 
 breakfast not included and u have to pay  per adult but they were clear from the bigining and mentioned that on booking 
 breakfast was   each which is very overpriced and even more so for small children not too sure where the decking area was where you can have a drink which is displayed in the pictures overlooking the london eye which is misleading 
 the pull out sofa bed was a little uncomfortable as the mattress wasn t very thick fairly understandable i suppose 
 stayed twice now and both times been charged for things we have not used we also had to change rooms as first room did not smell to good 
 room not cleaned next day had to request this bathroom smelled of rotten eggs the whole stay overcharged on mini bar bill had to prove we were staying there to concierge on nd night to get into our room 
 unfortunately we experienced a couple of problems with the restaurant and bar food which we considered to be of less than excellent quality and not sufficiently hot when served 
 not worth the money expensive and they even said they cant give us an hdmi cable so we could connect our laptop with the tv and the front desk guy was even rude when we asked i was very disappointed the rooms are smaller then they look on the pictures 
 bar area a bit like a wimpy bar also the restaurant area was more like a canteen however the food was far below even a canteen standard wouldn t touch the cooked breakfast on offer made do with fruit toast and coffee 
 there was a party one evening and the music was very loud until around  am i round suggest that families should be higher up in th hotel if there are functions planned 
 breakfast could have been warmer cooked food tasty but a little cold coffee really hot and good 
 couldn t fault anything our stay was perfect 
 attitude of some of the reception staff particularly at check in studio was smaller that i expected it came with a kitchenette but it was a squeeze to make a cup of coffee also fridge space could just about accommodate a  litre milk bottle not enough toiletries provided for a family of four two tellies provided but acoustics made it impossible to use both at the same time there seemed to be a time lag and echo between the two sets had to wait ages for sofa bed to be made up on the friday and saturday night not good when trying to maintain a routine for young kids steam room and sauna area needs to be cleaned more regularly lots of hair lying about and robes were tiny also black algae in our shower surround had to repeatedly get key card reactivated room was showing signs of wear and tear faucet tap was loose mirror was cracked worst of all was the stench from the drains this was stifling some times usually at night 
 nothing
 i am pretty sure when i booked it was suggested that breakfast was included but this wasn t the case parking information on area wasn t great although we did find a great deal after some searching other sites online 
 have stayed in a junior suite for several nights very bad house keeping not even a  star level leaving areas unclean never changing the bed sheets unless you told them they failed most of the nights to fill up nespresso capsules one night the whole floor was lost power it was returned back after half an hour without any apologies buffet breakfast was below average  per person the waiter asked for extra  for an omelet 
 well it s london so parking is a drag 
 just that it would have been better if she didnt have to walk across the walkway as she has a height phobia but you didn t know this 
 breakfast was very busy at peak times too much queuing for our liking but the food was good quality 
 both of the taps were warm so i couldn t get any cold water the dish towel was not very good and did not dry the dishes well
 a small thing it was difficult to get a fresh fried egg at breakfast time the egg fryer was not very cooperative and often unavailable they charge extra for an omelette 
 i stayed in room  at checkout reception didn t ask if i had a good stay and i forgot to mention my complaint as i was in a hurry heading off for a meeting room  has an adjoining door the noise from the next room into mine was ridiculous the door may as well have been left open i enjoyed multiple different people staying in the room next to me think  over course of my stay and was continually awoken at times ranging from midnight to  am in the morning i don t think they realised how think the space was between the adjoining doors this would put me off staying again at this hotel
 nothing
 queue at check in and flimsy frosted glass door on bathroom not sufficiently private for twin room
 better towels and more milk and sugar available in the room
 room for  people but serviced and adequate for  people only  double bed and  sofa instead of  separated bed 
 unfort we had a dreadful experience in the hotels italian eatery after waiting an hour got food the staff came to explain they had lost the order could we start again we were famished to start with the complimentary breadsticks did not really lift our dissapointment
 not a clean room bathroom floor tiles are broken and it s leaking in the shower cabin towels are not very clean it s not a white colour very old 
 the dining room was a little cold at the door end that didn t affect us as we were seated right by the servery but could have been uncomfortable for those at that end 
 doesn t have own car parking but there are places nearby 
 when i arrived there was a red blood looking stain on the bed cover and hairs near the toilet in the bathroom drinks were very expensive and room maids entered our room in the morning   times despite us telling them we did not require room maids which i m really not happy about we also started a tab in the bar which we agreed to pay upon checkout on our final day we then had a phone call at am whilst we were sleeping to tell us that the bill had to be paid instantly before they shut their tills it s such a shame because the location is excellent 
 upgraded to an executive room price was a little high for what you get was told it was a quite room but you could still here guest above us breakfast was okay but could of been better 
 i would say that our bathroom could do with being updated as it was noticeably rusty otherwise it was a great stay 
 personally we found the room rather claustrophobic difficult to explain the layout as the outside of the room was actually inside the building so had no view or natural daylight which was quite confusing at   this morning when i happened to wake just felt like we state of semi darkness the whole time we spent in the room fine for one night but had we have had a longer stay i would have to have asked if they had an outward facing room i don t like to sound like a cheapstake but breakfast was  each we opted to take a  minute walk around the corner and found a small decent caf and had a very adequate breakfast for  each
 a little confusion over the room i booked a superior double and was told that the room was a studio room this just put the booking in doubt also when we arrived in the room there were balloons and a bottle of wine with a card it was my partners birthday but the card had a different name on not my partner after i queried this the goodies were collected but it left us feeling that we were given the wrong room 
 restaurant has no spaghetti no garlic bread etc etc we were in a group of  and there was several dishes unavailable the desert was tiny wouldn t use the restaurant again
 the breakfast was not good value for money
 the pictures from online made it seem the room was bigger than actually was bathroom door i didn t like 
 restaurant quiet small very busy even at supposedly quiet times for breakfast we had to queue and wait for table as three of us staff tried hard to seat people asap city view was a view of the railway station not the view i expected
 very small breakfast room causing massive slow queues for breakfast long wait for lifts and house cleaning was poor when they turned up 
 every morning you have to stand in a line to get to the restourant for   minutes just to get your breakfast the windows are not opening in the room so there is no fresh air have problems with the safe box do not work and with the door to the room cant open need to call engenier 
 rainforest shower head dirty required cleaning before use alarm clock radio set to bst stay early january no instructions on how to reprogram
 the drench shower didn t work properly as holes blocked by lime scale so more of a drizzle however also had a normal shower attachment which worked fine 
 perhaps some recliners and relaxing chilling area in spa but this is in mo way a complaint
 the only thing was the washbasin tap that looked a little tired 
 the staff were poor on discovering a hair in my room service meal refused a refund of the whole meal just generally set up a bad scene for the remainder of the break away wanted to refund me the one meal i said the rest was ruined they came and collected all the food including the absolutely fine desserts before actioning a refund terribly backward way of customer service 
 there was nothing i didn t like about hotel or our stay 
 some language barrier with a member of staff as he didn t understand but overcome with help from his colleague
 only that the hairdryer didn t work and i had to wait quite a while for someone to bring me another one so my hair was nearly dry and not sitting right 
 there was a strange howling noise that disturbed my sleep in the morning i think it was the wind through the vents the breakfast was good but a little over priced
 no complaints
 ac and warm air needs to function better and be more user friendly 
 honestly my wife and i were really looking for a room with a view on london eye and or the big ben plus we did not like the bathroom door style a bit transparent and openable from outside our little son has no boundaries 
 the shower wasn t very hot and the windows didn t open at all which for one night was manageable but for a longer stay would have been a problem as we like fresh air 
 wifi signal television could be positioned in a better location
 honestly the only thing i would say is not great is the expensive mark up on drinks in the bar i understand the overheads etc but even so 
 did not like the same breakfast menu every day people with long stay gets bored with eating same thing again n again you need to change the menu on alternate days 
 no lock on bathroom toilet door glass door that slides not much of an issue 
 i booked using this site and i admit it was a little last minute however my savings via the website weren t showing up on their systems and they were going to take the full price at first in my case they were quick to resolve the issue however it took much longer to resolve the same problem for my colleagues also their system tried to take money from my card even after i had paid for my whole stay be vigilant and check your card now and then during your stay 
 a bit chilly in the main areas because open plan is contiguous with the front doors to the hotel 
 the room service meal was very poor a half toasted cheese sandwich with cold fries i asked for fresh brown bread way too expensive for the quality 
 the bar staff didn t explain they automatically added a discretionary service charge to each drink i questioned the price because it was  pence more than in the menu the barman was not happy and showed this when i asked him to remove the charge service was slow and the bar staff were not engaged the bar was not busy at the time 
 i felt the breakfast was expensive and there was a long line on sunday morning of people waiting to be seated however once seated the staff were extremely prompt and helpful 
 nothing to complain about 
 the only thing was the mattress on the sofa bed not thick enough 
 would have to say thought the bar prices were a bit steep even for london nearly  for a juice 
 not a bad experience but would suggest  armchairs in a double room would be handy instead of  especially if staying in room for a while and not wanting to lie on the bed this is really nit picking as room was very comfortable 
 rubbishy a c we stayed in winter and were rather uncomfortably warm i would say that the system could do with an overhaul prior to hotter months appreciate that lower windows cannot be opened due to height of hotel and local noise traffic etc however there were no risk upper windows that might have that facility if a c is an issue
 not a bad experience at all just a minor quibble please replace tinned orange segments with real orange slices grapefruit at breakfast also suggest replacing mackerel with smoked salmon 
 breakfast was cold and  extra for my boyfriend to have eggs benedict meaning his breakfast cost  and he didn t eat off the buffet
 the car park is very tight to park and their staff are rude and unhelpful although it was nothing to do with the hotel 
 small room sliding frosted glass bathroom door which didn t give much privacy when using the toilet contents of mini bar were too expensive breakfast at  a ahead is too expensive no natural light to room as window looked out to internal space
 the fact that there was dirty stinky socks in a cupboard and view to the train station
 staff has a poor level of english no bathrobe and slippers were provided tv and phones inside are very old paint coming off in some of the corners cleaners were knocking my door very early in the morning which was inconvenient overall poor value for money considering that i have paid  pounds for two nights 
 it was really busy and nosy so difficult to sleep if you are above the restaurant bar avoid rooms over the left side although they do have the best views it is very expensive even the food and drinks we ended up going out for everything 
 sliding glass door of the bathroom it doesn t fit the conception of park plaza in general needs something better 
 the one thing i d say is if using the restaurant avoid the steak
 poor checking in rooms tired wardrobe door didn t close no proper shower tray supposed to be suite with london eye view but could only see top of it and no skyline view
 room was not cleaned until very late afternoon bathroom floor was very wet after using the shower as the shower screen was not adequate room also felt quite cool with no way of increasing the temperature 
 elevators at rush hour temperature and air not easy to regulate in internal rooms 
 bar staff took forever to serve me and then was threatened with being thrown out when i complained customer service non existent manager apologized and gave me a bowl of fruit but by then the damage was done cleaning staff threw away medicine from my room safe did not work in my room paid nearly  pound for a room on new years eve and breakfast not included 
 nothing worth mentioning 
 breakfast items should change every so often staying there for  days the same breakfast items got old
 nothing
 the stay was awful dirty room unhelpful staff and the room was too small for three people not worth the money and very disappointing 
 the restaurant within the hotel had very slow service even when it wasn t particularly busy we had to ask the staff where the food was after waiting an hour when the food came it wasn t worth the wait 
 rooms too warm even with a c turned to cool disable accessible shower flooding the floor of ablutions esp arround toilet design of panel allowing water to run out of shower 
 very slow lifts lots of guests taking the stairs the room for a junior suite was a little tired 
 internet tv was hopeless sound and picture were not in sync and no amount of rebooting etc would cure this the shower in the room had no edge to the shower tray meaning water went all over the bathroom floor hopeless design fault offered a high floor room and disappointed to discover it was internal with no views at all 
 the double room was just a big single had to pay for expensive soya milk to use with complimentary tea and coffee drinks at bar very expensive extremely high sided bath made using the shower potentially dangerous
 nothing
 had to queue for breakfast on the saturday for quite awhile and was a bit hectic tables very close together
 still think the price is a little high i did get a deal on my stay but still thought it a little expensive overall
 i asked for three beds for three men and we were given only  beds one rolled over sofa which was extremely uncomfortable rusty taps in bedroom very loud aircondition even our executive room was tiny and we paid a lot of money for this discomfort 
 in floor one especially room number  it is very noisy and couldn t sleep at night because of the continuous noises coming from the service lifts one of the managers and some of the reception staff are very rude and impolite and i can add more details in this regard if you want 
 had to ask for sofa bed to be made up and extra towels although booked for  adults 
 we were asked if we wanted to upgrade to a studio with a view of the london eye it was gbp per night but the view was obstructed and not worth the extra outlay in my opinion 
 some staff could not speak english very well especially the woman that checked us out cook had difficult time making eggs to order 
 slow service in the bar early morning i wanted a coffee to go but simply didn t really want to serve opened a few cupboards looking for take away cups so i said i d leave it and i got one elsewhere 
 light in wardrobe kept turning on even when doors are closed location of toilet paper had to twist and lean down and it strained my back 
 much further from train station than anticipated one say room was not cleaned completely but once discovered staff were speedy in rectifying situation 
 hotel was a bit hot 
 i don t like having to pay a service charge thats forced on me by the bill in the bar area i always tip anyway we did have our money taken twice for the room but this was explained on our arrival as a rd party mistake problem was rectified competently on arrival by the duty manager and we were offered a free upgrade and complimentary drink which was nice breakfast was extra and far too expensive even for a london hotel 
 bar service at a glacial pace 
 we only had two issues on the last morning of our stay the hot water wasn t working in the shower disappointing also we had room service for breakfast but the order only  correct 
 shower room was a little small and the door opened inwards and brushed the edge of the toilet it was spotless and well equipped so i am being a little picky 
 the mattress on the sofa bed in the studio was filthy with at least five horrid blood stains the shower hose was leaking and the sink was dripping on to the scales stored under it needless to say the scales had long stopped working as a result as they were soaked in water 
 nothing it was great 
 being a club carlson member and having upgraded the room on arrival for an additional  total of  to include breakfast and a view i would have expected more than a pair of slippers no dressing gowns only three tea bags only two tissues in box in bathroom and a duvet which only just covered the bed on arrival at breakfast we were told we had not pre paid and subsequently seated on a table totally surrounded by other tables guest bags etc so you weren t able to get out without inconveniencing people by asking them to move no explanation of how the buffet worked and no offer to top up tea this is a shame as we have stayed here on a number of occasions previously and experienced fantastic second service 
 only one member of staff that we dealt with had english as their first language resulting in us struggling to understand them and them most certainly not understanding us we also found someone else s dried urine on the loo seat upon arrival we contacted housekeeping but they didn t understand us so it wasn t rectified until we had yo go to reception and complain 
 breakfast are was very cramped and the food quality was below average sausages were not nice tasting fried egg had a hard yolk nd bed in the room was a sofa bed very uncomfortable for   for one night also the air con only worked on one side of the room and the hotel was extremely hot everywhere we went not just in the room 
 did not like the st room we were given however without too much trouble we were able to change to a nicer room the restaurant leaves a lot to be desired far too many people for such a small restaurant not enough room to enjoy breakfast leisurely 
 had to chase for room servicing day two and then not serviced very well decided to do it myself 
 the reception staff is not at all courteous after paying so much they need extra money for everything we asked for good view room they need extra money for it we asked for late check out they need extra money for it the hotel does not have a lobby for spending some time you sit in the caf and they want that we should order something so that they get money the rooms are so small i will not recommend this hotel to anybody 
 nothing 
 small rooms with the inside ones having windows onto the atrium were strange overlooked by passage way on other side of the atrium and claustrophobic with curtains for privacy and no connection to daylight
 glass door into bathroom short bath incomprehensible shower controls mystery phone rings in morning
 long queue for breakfast in the hotel but there are plenty of restaurants and cafes nearby 
 room not ready at pm checked in at pm no credit card was asked for at checkin caused a lot of issues when ordering drinks once into room we waited  hours while it was cleaned it was filthy dirt all over the bathroom 
 the alarm system was started at am and we left the hotel to the evacuation point and we were asking the hotel stuff but every one gives us a a different reason then in the day after at pm the alarm started again and then we left the hotel again but they told us it was a test test at pm 
 no issues would recommend visit and stay to friends and others 
 the italian restaurant was a bit too low level with respect to the overall impression of the hotel inspite the chianti was superb the bar service was super lousy
 fire alarm was working  times the first one was at  am and the second was at pm and they said it was test while they asked of evacuated and all the gust went to the evacuation point 
 breakfast is the same all monring i stayed  nights and every morning you had same things little bit boring but 
 we stayed here  times during our holiday and a couple of the rooms on the lower floors were a bit tired soap holders falling out of the wall fridges that didn t work etc 
 the minuses were athough they did not influence me to give a goog review is that the restaurant may not be so expensive but we had room service once had a basic pizza and it was horrible and it costed  the second situation was in the hotel bar when the waiter took our order we waited  minutes for a drink and again waited after he renturned for the second time 
 we dropped our luggage off early which we were told is not a problem but when we checked in later we were told that our luggage had been taken to our room but had not it then took  calls to reception and a wait of  hr for it to arrive making us late for our evening meal 
 for our visit the hotel was rather overcrowded because of half term long waits for the lifts and long queues for breakfast although we hoped for a view over the river we looked over waterloo station 
 wasn t given a good room room had no view or window to outside so was claustrophobic was charged twice so wasn t able to access my money i specifically bought for my trip 
 poor view from our room nd floor to a car park bins sofa bed for kid should have a thicker mattress
 the bed it was a little flat futon looking and not very comfortable 
 i booked a family room for  adults  children ages   but on arrival i was given a standard superior double room with just  double bed  people on  bed was extremely uncomfortable having travelled for almost  hours prior to getting to the hotel around midnight i was simply top tired to complain however my family i were very disappointed 
 i dined in the restaurant the food and house wine were of poor quality the lasagne gave me indigestion all night and what was described as a cheesecake was a mousse on a biscuit base the d cor crude black and white paintings of famous italian scenes was appalling 
 the staff is unfriendly and unhelpful not all of them but mark was so tough and unhelpful another lady caused me the problem of having another room reserved and paid without chick in she supposed to contact the reservation for me since morning and she did not do anything in more than  hours the guest manager did not help me as well and never apologise for inconvinience i was not waiting to refund my money but at least to give me my right to use the room anf to apologise come on they know nothing about communicating with customer their english is poor a man in the comcierge treated me like a he shouted in my face resusing to bring my luggage bcause he is too busy right now while i have not asked him to bring them immedietely i had then to bring them by my seld the blond gentelman in concierge was so friendly and polite and apologised to me for what his colleage did finally i would never go back to that hotel i paid more than  per night and staid for  nights the value for my money was zero
 bed was not the most comfortable inside room so no natural daylight
 no view we looked right into the back of waterloo station but we were not in that much to look at the view so it was nt really important we did not have breakfast as it was very expensive which was a shame 
 one of the staff blocked amount from the credit card as it is prepaid mastercard without asking that she will do that however i was planning to pay all amount in cash as well as she charged from the card deposit amount without informing us this is impolite and unethical way 
 the only thing wrong was the height of the bath tub as i am not very tall  ft  and i hurt myself getting in and out of the bath and has a result my legs has bruises on the front and back 
 room wasnt ready had to wait  mins was offered a free drink but only beer or wine we got a flat glass of prosecco expected better considering  for  night stay had to pay extra for breakfast  a head too
 noisy dark rooms fruits from breakfast spoiled personal didn t realy care the spa sauna and steam bath very small and dirty just no fun at all absolutely too expensive for what you get 
 room was small highly overpriced and noisy bathroom looked tiered and time for a change or refed not worth the price paid never again 
 nothing
 room was small air con did not work poor check in breakfast luke warm damaged hair dryer replaced staff unsure of breakfast payment and aggressively interrupted our food terrible phone service when questioned by customer service 
 bed uncomfortable too hard probably past its sell by food drinks very expensive 
 room a little small extremely high step to get into the bath shower 
 while the room was good enough for our short visit its inside facing position would have been disappointing for a longer stay 
 a world of difference between the outward city view facing room and the internal room with its futuristic lift and darkness ask for the city view when booking 
 tables for breakfast are too close for every ones comfort a little too far from london underground stations to walk with suitcases a large lounge area would be great 
 the   surcharge that is in the small print any tips should go to the staff and not back to the company coffers this is not fair and not clearly stated 
 the design and layout of the toilet make less sense since the flush button is behind the lavatory cover and the toilet paper rolls are quite inconvenient to reach but after all it is not a problem 
 overly priced for a  star hotel even in good location  per person per night for breakfast 
 issue with the room choice we paid extra for a city view got to our room to find a view of train station which wasn t pleasant complained at reception to get a response saying u can see the shard barely could she then went on to say they were nearly fully booked we still weren t happy so she spoke to the manager and he said we could upgrade and get a better view for just  which we weren t happy for as we had originally paid extra for a view that we never got to have to pay even more breakfast busy took forever to get a fried egg that someone stole our seats never got offered tea or coffee after asking someone for tea they brought over with no milk so had to ask again 
 booked the penthouse great views but room in the small side considering the price
 no fridge it is only for extras 
 to long to check in and the sounds coming up from the restaurant woke me and my friends up at am saturday morning and sunday morning the radio was so pound that i thought that someone was having a party the spoiled the week end for us
 room was internal with no natural light and a windows overlooking restaurant fine for a night but no longer 
 didn t dislike anything but would be helpful to have more glasses in the room bar is ok but not a touch on park plaza westminster bridge next door 
 on the first evening i asked for some more milk and sugar which i never received shower hose had leak making the water shoot off to the right stingy with the toiletries barely enough for two people room too hot air conditioning either not working properly or performing to its optimum
 the breakfast was too expensive 
 couldnt find anything 
 staff were terrible on check in we arrived late and last minute so booked on bookings com beforehand when we arrived they said their system hadn t updated and we were then treated like an inconvenience despite showing booking references and confirmations one receptionist even pulled faces and thought it was funny more training of late night reception staff interestingly the trainee receptionist was actually the most personable of them all 
 how cold it was in london 
 originally booked a room with twin beds for my granddaughter and me however the only window faced an interior wall no way to tell the weather so i had to change the accommodation 
 the cooling compartment to put our things was very small compared to the minibar in the room
 breakfast was poor and i had to wait an hour with  kids to check in i artived an hour early before checking so went for food and came back an hour and  min later room still not ready had to sit in the bar for  min with me asking  times is room ready yet before being allowed to are room and spending money in bar that i didn t have we then had to rush as we had booked attachions and where going to miss them due to waiting for out room
 we were disappointed that breakfast wasn t included in the price of the room as considering the price was almost  per night also i was charged for  adults in the room when in fact there was only one adult and  children 
 staff was extremely slow to respond to requests for assistance sometimes taking them hours to fulfill a request  for  days in which i sat in a hotel room because i hurt my back assisting one of your employees get the curtains untangled from the balcony door
 when i first got there i had room with broken a c but when i called the reception they changed it for me right away
 breakfast was chaos we waited forever for all cooked items and when bacon arrived it was so under cooked we ordered fried eggs but they only arrived as we left the table the que was huge even thou breakfast served till am and we were there at  am in our room there was a big rip in the carpet which was very dangerous for my dad as he his legs are not to gd
 the breakfast area is too small and the queue was unacceptable in such a lovely hotel the tea was weak and the hot food was only warm and on one occasion the mushrooms were cold the staff were very helpful but the breakfast system needs to be reviewed 
 the sofa bed was hard and uncomfortable in the studio room i felt the breakfast should have been included in the price as it was quite a lot of money to pay 
 breakfast is good but way overpriced like most london hotels have to avoid rush hour times and can be quite noisy
 the main bed was great the opened sofa terrible hard uneven small lucky for us the cm male can sleep almost everywhere but this will not fit  persons or any type of a princess 
 it was all wonderful
 couldn t check in until   expensive coffee whilst waiting for check in 
 the floor to ceiling window meant there was no fresh air but the air conditioning was adjusted from the hotel norm to make it more comfortable for us 
 some of thw reception staff have communication issues and do not understand your requirements if you don t have to communicate with them it s a great stay the housekeeping and staff at the restaurant are excellent and work really hard 
 stayed in same room several months ago reported bed was lumpy and extremely uncomfortable obviously the same mattress still housekeeping was poor bits on floor lampshade still stained no bath robes 
 i booked  executive suites and for the cost of these rooms we did not expect sofa beds also the rooms were very small and felt crowded

 no city tours
 price 
 nothing
 sofa bed broken 
 rooms needs to be more cleaner and better ac
 no instructions on multiple bath taps which was shower or whatever got soaked while trying to run bath
 small things pencil was broken bottles for the shower gel were tiny 
 the usual breakfast problem with soggy bacon that is stuck together 
 lights in room did not work shower is awkward to use 
 breakfast i personally felt should of been more choice of cereals
 small rooms
  pillows go flat wen herd lays on them just as well lay herd on bed not good
 room wasn t ready in time for check in room needed maintenance
 now swimming pool
 nothing
 disappointed that the executive lounge was not open 
 beeakfast restaurant is very tight and quite small for the size of the hotel and number of guests
 the couch in the room was broken so you couldn t sit and chill
 bed breakfast staff
 slow lifts even away from busy breakfast times
 queue for breakfast
 asked for  rooms next to each other before booking due to  children under  yrs not available when we got there
 staff bed breakfast
 staff unattentive to requests of problrms with room
 not many restaurants very near the hotel
 booked a twin room was given a double room they did change but should not of happened
 nothing 
 room very small
 breakfast was served on cold plates and cooked food went cold too quickly
 the spa was very disappointing just  cheap beds round the pool nowhere else to sit the treatments weee nice but not good value for money
 the shower cubicle in the bathroom was very small for this rating of hotel don t drop anything the great water pressure made up for the lack of space in shower though 
 tea and coffee facilities should be in the room although you could phone reception and ask for them i feel they should have been there without asking the room could have been bigger
 considering the reports and ratings that are celebrating the hotel we were slightly disappointed the furniture of the suite looked a little worn out and old fashioned you can hear the toilet flush from the adjactent floors in the bathroom all in all it doesn t feel very personal and private in the room breakfast is terribly over priced a usual thing in a lot of hotels to be honest and not worth writing home about would definetly choose another hotel in london next time 
 the really noisy flushing toilet which was like you get on an airplane and so loud i was woken by the plumbing in adjoining rooms
 although i have commended the breakfast it was possibly a little over the top there really was more food than anyone could sensibly require my niece had to ask for her pillows to be changed as she has an allergy to goose and duck down replacements were provided immediately and without question but were far too big the staff s anxiety to please is perhaps a little overpowering for people like us who are not wealthy but can manage an occasional special treat 
 i understand that room rates are high in this part of london and that one aldwych is a very high standard hotel with hr room service but i felt that it wouldn t be too much to ask for tea and coffee making facilities in the room and that breakfast items were very expensive even compared to the restaurant dinner prices however the pub across the road serves an excellent breakfast at less eye watering prices 
 having to leave wish we could of stayed longer 
 nothing
 i think the staff were a little too suggestive in having extras but this was minor we had a fruit side plate for breakfast but didn t really need this so ended up not eating it 
 noisy kids in pool meant i didn t go in but it was easter so to be expected i guess 
 nothing to dislike the rooms are as you would expect in a  hotel beds comfortable bathrooms are fine 
 room very small wardrobe access in particular small shower access over the bath not easy for one of us being over  years young a room with a walk in shower is quite a bit more expensive the lounge facilities for residents is limited 
 outdated room design much nicer in pictures than real life was very disappointed expected it to be nicer for a  star hotel loud plumbing noises in bathroom after use of water 
 the bed was too hard thats all 
 for what iv paid  for  night didnt even gt a breakfast we could av been told that thers a safe in room the chair in  was disgustig filthy wasnt very impressed with the service
 incredibly noisy miniscule bedroom broken toilet water issue plumber finally fixed it at am key for adjoining room opened ours at the same time guided to sit infront of lift when having a drink in the bar receptionist in the morning a complete robot knew we d had a terribly night instead of starting off with an apology she asked if we d had a good night i commented that there were a few issues to which she replied oh yes i heard for  night and  glass of fizz i don t expect the adjoining room to open my door have a waterfall in the middle of the night nor do i expect to relax sip champagne in front of a lift shambolic faulty towers 
 the breakfast was not up to the level of the rest of the experience at this hotel expensive and not tasty slow service
 i booked five nights and each night i was charged a different rate i booked my stay through booking com although the booking site mentioned a daily rate i was very disappointed that at the time of check out the front desk charged me  different rates i wonder who s responsible for this lapse hotel or the booking engine ota 
 the walk in shower was pretty tiny 
 leaving
 breakfast to order not ideal for young children even part buffet would help film projection in pool great idea but unfortunately you can t really see it 
 toilet blocked and drains noisy would have preferred a walk in shower as rim of bath far too high for short person to step into 
 the staff were a little over attentive although very polite at lunch i felt uncomfortable as the staff were coming over what seemed like every mins 
 pillows were terrible a five star hotel should have a selection of pillows to choose from our hotel room door lock was missing so it didn t feel very secure the bathroom was quite tired and old fashioned plus the pump was noisy cocktails were expensive and although tasty lacked much alcohol the hotel bar and restaurant were not that of a five star hotel and lacked ambience the pool was average again a little tired and the health club did not feel like that of w five star hotel 
 we arrived to a king bed when my girlfriend and i specifically wanted and booked twin beds the lag time in getting this handled was a bit annoying because the desk clerk did not take this seriously enough evidently he does not travel because he was very disrespectful of our request and a bit argumentative car to airport did not arrive agostinho was not on duty and we waited at least  minutes prior to getting into a cab i personally checked on the car about  minutes prior to departing and he had not arrived which i found unusual for great britain but then at the specific time and he still was not there i felt that a call should have been made promptly rather than waiting for us to have to ask  minutes later hopefully these comments can be taken in a positive way to help improve customer service for this very nice facility 
 no wow factor and there was one waiter that did all the things you shouldn t do as a waiter at breakfast leaning across you etc
 it did take  attemps to get firm pillowes for are beds they need to be a bit more clearer some were be it on the web sight or checking iin about the extra surcharge put on hold on the credit card i did get confused 
 room was quite small for a luxury double and the bathroom was quite basic with small single wash basin and basic small glass enclosed shower 
 the water saving toilet flush is very loud in the middle of the night but better for the environment 
 actual bedroom was a little small but to be fair it had all the necessary resources 
 to have been offered the  for  nights offer by the hotel which we were unaware of as we would loved to have stayed another night 
 a possible inconvenience for business travellers is that the in room safe is not large enough for a laptop
 the foyer bar was lovely but gets very busy no where else as a guest to go and chill out if full
 small grumble we had the afternoon tea however there was a special reception in the lobby bar in connection with the baftas so we had to eat in the general dining area i think we should have been told that when we booked then we asked if we could chose where we sat and were told no as certain tables were reserved for regular diners no one sat at any of those tables the entire time we were there 
 my wife had a poor cut of meat when in the restaurant but when we advised the staff the whole issue was handled very well 
 nothing  aldwych in my opinion is perfect
 from the moment you arrive reception staff are rude unfriendly and in the bar area the staff ignored us for  mins then when we sat at a empty reserved table as we only wanted one drink before we went to dinner we were kicked off the table in an abrupt manner we went to the bar area couldn t get served left after  mins table still sitting empty will never return
 one little point i had for milk for my tea every day of a  night stay 
 no bad experience but surely this quality of hotel should provide complimentary tea coffee water in rooms on arrival 
 i say this after every visit but please put tea and coffee making facilities in every room and an iron very cheap b and bs do this so why not an exclusive hotel 
 not much choice of food on the room service menu would have liked hot chocolate in addition to tea and coffee in room 
 room quite small tv faced  degrees to the bed so no possibility of watching it wardrobe light would not go off bathroom very noisy when other floors used their needed better soundproofing in the bathroom bedroom was fine 
 the serving of the breakfast took a long time the dining room was very cold air condition 
 your question on who travel with i have a wife not a partner please add spouse to options in that section
 can t fault in any way
 room not large
 room was very small not what i was expecting at all 
 no kettle in room
 the room was very chilly 
 the twin beds couldn t be separated may as well have shared a bed with my business partner 
 very expensive
 for the price per night there should be free wifi 
 the pool needed more chairs around it
 for a five star hotel charging  a night for a room at the very least there should be coffee and tea making facilities
 cramped bathroom
 the room was smaller than expected
 room was quite small for the price paid 
 price
 the room was quite small and nothing special for  a night 
 bed too hard bathroom ok but shower needed updating needs a nespresso in the room 
 water system in room very noisy something to do with teh enviornmental system 
 staff tries to be nice and some are but over all feeling of hotel was disapointing for the price
 the lounge area is a bit small side and therefore gets busy quickly other than that the place is excellent 
 noisy toilet lack of tea coffee facilities in the room
 traffic and location didn t work for us 
 breakfast room was quite busy on second day and service was a little slow 
 no coffee or tea making facilities in room 
 all good
 no tea or coffee facilities in the room
 nothing not to like 
 bathroom
 wish we had a safe
 no tea making facilities and room service up to mins in not good enough 
 executive room was on small side
 noisy drainage system
 the breakfast menu was confusing and the cost was too high 
 room extremely cramped too much furniture and bathroom full of dangerous sharp edges 
 the breakfast was too pricy 
 paying  for one night not including breakfast so in total  
 nothing
 nothing slightly noisy drains from the bathroom but nothing to get upset about 
 fussy srvice
 more beds around pool
 no tea or coffee making facilities
 no tea coffee facilities in the room
 the bar was too busy to serve us on saturday evening
 i would prefer a breakfast buffet quality of food far breakfast did vary from day to day 
 for the same cost i had a much smaller adjoining room than my daughter in law and granddaughter and for that reason i felt i should have paid less 
 room was small
 restaurant and bar closed sunday evening not informed in the website water in the room first night only why do hotels charge a lot for the room then not leave water complimentary in the room we were told to walk to the shop at  pm for water 
 wifi was very weak i was able to get it on my laptop computer but could not get connection on my ipad or iphone 
 nothing
 nothing no faults at all 
 nothing
 the bed is supposed to be king size and actually it is very small and uncomfortable too much nose because of contraction that they did not warned me about it which they should inform me once i booked the staff are very rude you asked them for a missing item in the room kleenex towel toothbrush etc they had an attitude 
 the lifts are a bit small so big suitcases might be a problem 
 staff was friendly but could be slightly more helpful when asking some directions for a good place to eat missing a bar or place for a drink limited shops and restaurants in the direct area unless you cross over to the high street champs drinks in the minibar are overpriced  for a simple coke but this is a more paris issue in general perhaps 
 can t think of anything we didn t like 
 the wifi was extremely poor there are a limited number of logins allowed shared across the entire hotel you would have to keep refreshing the login page and hope that someone logged out of the wifi or turned it off so that you could get connected 
 there are not many facilities like swimming pool or gym and the different areas are very smal like the breakfast room the lobby or the bar not hot food for breakfast 
 the breakfast was too expensive and  euros meant that i never got to try the breakfast 
 all good but if the breakfast was included it would have been perfect the room was very good on rd floor and balcony view of the arch 
 wifi was not working for half of my  day stay
 the breakfast hot breakfast items need to be refreshed more often eg at  the bacon was crispy
 bed too small for a double way over charging during the euro  championship but i guess all other hotels in paris where doing the same 
 breakfast not included cleaning lady frequently ignored do not disturb sign even though we complained about it at the front desk 
 staff member being loudly told off by lady manageress i assume she was right but not in front of client never do that saturday evening at pm left outside of hotel door locked desk unmanned not good 
 the bed was a bit hard but that s probably personal preference 
 the room photos on the website do not entirely correspond to reality because only newly renovated rooms are shown but we received an older room although very clan 
 cleaning staff changes our staff locations for example my wife arranged her makeup on the disk the moment we arrived but the cleaners take it and put it in the bathroom very expensive compared to the service and the room and the facilities in the hotel the room was so small very hot room there was no air conditioning in the hotel and they refused to open the a c because the manager closed it until our last night they opened it 
 the breakfast was really expensive  per person
 loud nights during the weekends people screaming shouting from nearby bars
 the wines provided are terrible and expensive  for half bottle we were very disappointed specially because france is famous for good wine we opened  bottles rose and red and only had a sip as it was horrible we were also charged for a bottle of white wine which we didn t have although we do think they charged us by mistake and we didn t realised while checking out to ask them to remove it 
 the beds was little uncomfortable
 leaving 
 change the carpet in the halls for wooden floor please 
 no privacy there s no lock on the door so we couldn t lock it the house keeping staff entered the room while we were sleeping and we got panic elevators are pretty small 
 the lobby smell and the redecoration during our stay small lobby with no space and facilities 
 one receptionist did not speak english and made it difficult to communicate requests all other employees were very helpful and accommodating 
 every things were perfect the staff were so friendly and the location was even wonderful
 the view from the window didn t match the price we paid for the room
 no downsides that i can think of 
 nothing 
 the bed was too small i don t think it s made to fit  people
 the restaurant does not work sundays

 rare for one of my posts but no faults zero the perfect stay 
 i can t find any faults 
 there were no outlets in the bathroom police sirens were loud at night but weren t frequent very quiet otherwise don t use the elevator if you re claustrophobic we squished  adults and a  lb child but more as a challenge 
 everything was great 
 bath towels are the size of a face towel for an american hotel i would have thought that they would have had bath towels fits for the average american i am not american who are rather larger than the average european 
 very small thing i m short the side of the tub shower combo was a bit tall to climb over 
 nothing
 slightly slow internet 
 the air conditioner stopped working but the staff were very apologetic and gave us a fan for our room and a complimentary breakfast 
 no mini bar no slippers no toothbrush a bit disappointing for a  stars hotel 
 the place could do with a revamp but they don t need to try harder because they have the traffic anyway
 the room was small the elevator was quaintly small and the staff s directions were correct but not always easy to follow for example they would say turn right then go until the street ended then turn right and what you wanted was right there but they wouldn t know the names of the street or tell you that right there meant cross a major street and go  or  blocks 
 nothing 
 not really a restaurant or bar but opposite the hotel there is a fantastic wine bar and there are plenty of restaurants in the area to explore 
 the elevator is small 
 elevator could be bigger but that s only because the age of the building we managed ok 
 the housekeeping was a little flaky face towel disappeared and never returned milk wasn t topped up room was small but parisian hotels usually are double glazing would be good despite being on th floor there was noticeable street noise we had a really good deal on the price i do not know if i would have been so happy paying full price 
 i really don t understand how this hotel has a four star rating my room was very small super dark and it wasn t the cleanest hotel room i saw no drinking water in the room or fridge staff is not at all friendly or hospitable they asked me to pay the day before my check out like i was a thief or something similar and i felt very uncomfortable about this i travel for work every week and i have visited hundreds of hotels and honestly this was the first time i felt this way the location is excellent but it is possible to find much better options at the same cost or even cheaper 
 shower enclosure in bathroom did not prevent the bathroom from flooding each time i took a shower 
 limited interaction with hotel staff more to do with the position and height of the reception desk relative to the exit 
 breakfast costs  euros but is quite limited no fruits and vegetables are not fresh but most people go for breakfast at nearby cafes anyway 
 room is cleaned a bit late in the day after lunch 
 all great for me thanks 
 no shower door so the bathroom got very wet after showers
 we had requested a quiet room the room we had  was connected to an adjoining room through locked double doors it meant we could sometimes hear the conversations of its occupants luckily they were not too noisy people it should not have been allocated to us if they are going to use two rooms for separate parties then they should brick up and soundproof the connecting space 
 room is small but is normal in paris facility is a little bit old but kept clean and everything works 
 we were told we got upgraded on arrival to the eiffel tower view room wow great in we go into the smallest elevator ever people max to the top floor the room was tiny but yes the balcony did have a view of the eiffel tower for what that was worth what they failed to tell us also was that one of the shower panels was completely missing i mean if we turned on the shower the water had nowhere else to go but all over the bathroom floor crazy we informed reception and were given a different room which turned out to be twice the size of our upgraded room and we could still see the eiffel tower from the balcony so much for upgrades
 lacking on the fine details some tlc will help but it doesn t bother or hinder the experience at all one just notice those things 
 the wifi was quite slow at times it seems to be unusable depending on the time of day when hotel guests were around 
 size of the double bedroom makes it not too roomy for  people the  beds were basically set as one king size bed which is not good if you don t want to sleep next to the other person 
 some staff could be more friendly and a proper lounge with a bar to relax in would have been nice bathroom was very jaded and shower over bath had a slippery surface 
 in the closet was dust i had to clean hangers at first and then put my things
 a lovely well placed hotel i was however only able to afford it when on offer 
 i think the price for breakfast at  euros per day is too expensive but you wont find anything cheaper nearby 
 in both the rooms we have stayed in it was difficult to take a shower without flooding the entire bathroom 
 staff rude i had pre paid before we had arrived when we got to the hotel because we didn t have the credit card used we had to pay cash on arrival there was no need for this as the room was already payed for so we had to pay twice hotel is quite old fashioned not up to star standards rooms are very small also bathroom wouldn t return again 
 could only have the continental breakfast in your room dont understand why room was pretty compact though comfortable not sure where i would have put the breakfast see above
 room claustrophically small very dark decor even with all the room lights on it was very difficult to see what you were reading or look at a map lighting better in bathroom which was were we planned the day out if you put your suitcase at bottom of bed there was no floor walking space handles on chest of drawers came off everytime you opened one safe wouldn t program right so didn t use it skimpy small hard towels in bathroom hotel further out than it appeared on maps to main tourist attractions on line photos made hotel look modern luxurious and large it s a very small lobby and maximum  suitcases and  people in elevator hated stepping off elevator into darkened hallway this was due to economy lighting and dark wood and dark colours on walls a few steps brought the hallway lights on and in general place was quaint couldn t imagine coping with kids in such small twin room we d requested separate twin beds but basically got a divided bed with one headboard we made do but was not ideal for two separate adults to use was ok for purpose used but not one i would recommend to others 
 the bathroom could be better designed 
 only thing i can complain about was that the batteries were dead in the remote 
 room service was overly expensive more than nice fine dining and when we tried to book airport shuttle times were not convenient 
 the ceiling in the room was leaking water in two spots in the toilet and beside the air conditioning the cleaning service threw away a hair conditioning of ours and the hotel did not have one to replace it also there were many bags of garbage from the cleaning service blocking the lift s door and in the middle of the corridor not very pleasant at all in the eve s overnight the card did not open the reception door and we got stuck outside the hotel for  minutes at a negative temperature until someone opened the door 
 very very small rooms central heating had air in it and clicked all night what anoyed me was at check out i told the staff and in typical french maner the girl could not care less not even a cursory sorry nothing strange for a us owned business 
 breakfast staff considering the rates for breakfast did not do enough e g direct customers to the coffee machine and milk 
 room is a little bit too small 
 on the first day we arrived internet was really good but for the other days i cannot say that it was fast also hair dryer isnt good if you have thin hair that dries slowly as mine you have to bring your own 
 the room was too small for the price the heat didn t work we had a heater to keep us warm no slippers for a star hotel 
 decaf espresso is not available for breakfasr
 all was good
 room not well sound proofed internet spamodic difficult ss business trip 
 the shower should have had a bigger glass partition to keep water from getting on the floor we had trouble getting clean face cloths every day 
 the bathroom was outdated and dirty with mouldy tiles dirt around the toilet parts and peeling and cracked paint bodged tiles the bedroom was lovely but extremely dusty i had to use wet wipes to dust the bed head etc as i have a dust allergy and was kept awake the first night coughing in the day light i realised why 
 room very small dark and rather claustrophobic bed at an angle to fit it in the tiny room bed pretty small too room was hot and although window opened it faced on to back of building with all the noisy air conditioning and heating boilers 
 room was a little small but that wasn t really a problem you trade that for the great location anyday 
 i wanted to give another guarantee card than the one i had prepaid with and the guy at the desk was new and demanded that i repay my booking with the new card which i did and they reimbursed me on the initial card but i suffered a foreign exchange supplementary cost of  
 small rooms smelly corridors no soundproof fake pictures on the offer there are superior classic rooms and superior delux classic are actually former rooms of the servants with separate staircase etc etc
 the lift i don t think i d want more than two people at a time or one plus one case personally i wasn t prepared to chance it so i walked up and down the four flights of stairs every time bed not very comfy ordering room service time consuming and only after doing so and having to wait minutes for order did we realise it was outsourced and not done by hotel 
 rooms are very outdated old furniture nasty bathrooms which need a complete overhaul lighting extremely poor rooms small by u s standards hotel rating too high for such poor quality and facilities 
 air conditioning was quite poor at  degrees it was way too cold we preferred to open the window but it s not always an option dust noise lightning might be better bed lights high above the bed and no ceiling lamp and lightning above the mirrow in the bathroom for doing make up 
 rooms were a bit small but it s paris so this was expected 
 yes it is paris style but the room and the elevator seem really too small 
 bathroom a little cramped but to be expected for this age of building staff at reception were excellent 
 room is small they don t have their own parking space but on street its available 
 no complaints 
 the receptionist was impersonal eg asked me if i liked paris but couldnt care less about my answer poor qulity toilet paper terrible quality long life milk in rooms dark rooms with deep red decor gloomy 
 the bathroom was very small and the lift was slow and small the room while not huge was ok for paris 
 the breakfast was too widely spread it took a while to realise how much choice there was
 door was a little touchy tried not to wake entire hall
 no free parking as stated when booked only a public car park which cost us  for  days breakfast was not included in the price even though it was suggested this was the case at check in  for  people a day is an absolute rip off 
 narrow hallways and staircases tiny elevator and you still have to go up and down a half flight of stairs this was okay for us but those with mobility issues or a lot of heavy luggage might have problems 
 tables were not cleaned up and the buffet was not replenished staff totally indifferent had to ask several times for items like bread yogurts very small elevator hardly enough for two certainly not enough room for a suitcase 
 i was really unhappy when there where no tables ready for breakfast staff was hiding in a kitchen and did not clean tables and did not prepare tables for new guests i start to prepare table myself as there were nobody to ask for help lady in charge appears in fey minutes and start to follow her duties next time i will avoid to have breakfast in this hotel 
 some minor things beds a little hard a bar fridge in room would have been good carpet in need of some repair in entry to room 
 very thin wall if someone who cannot pay attention to the neighborhood unfortunately stays in the next to your room that s too bad i tried to be patient but i finally knocked the wall at  am in the midnight in order to stop happy laughing british english conversation i could not use the air conditioner because i found a lot of black mold in it then i did not feel good 
 very small lift the room was small for  people but adequate via european standards 
 i had a room on the top floor which actually gave me a rooftop view of paris unfortunately it was like being in an attic the sloped roof took up half of the small room it was difficult to navigate around the very hard bed to get to the wardrobe and i had to stand on a chair to use the safe it was also extremely hot even with the air conditioner running all of the time the windows did open but with no screens there were issues with mosquitos and birds flying in i didn t change my room because i didn t spend much time in it 
 breakfast could be a little better limited choice 
 room was a bit on the small side had no view 
 the room was a little on the small side the selection on offer at breakfast could have been better the breakfast offerings was also a bit scattered not everything was positioned in the same area of the room it would have been nice to have fresh drinking water in the room every day not just on the first day more information about excursions in the room would have been good
 its location is really good so street noise is variable even with the great windows 
 dim lighting would have liked a brighter light near to the desk 
 didn t like not to be able to get extra pillows when we requested them 
 walls are really thin and you can clearly hear everything from the surrounding rooms 
 poor communication due to language barrier we found it hard to ask nor just say simple words in english
 the bathroom was quite small
 elevator no room service tiny rooms name on booking com is different than on hotel signs
 amazing location
 the room was really small with a tiny window with view to the air conditions system of the hotel 
 the carpets could do with a shampoo the air con could be upgraded
 breakfast was not consistent for food and service 
 a little too small rooms 
 no issues at all
 not much
 poor service from most not all of the staff and the air conditioning did not work 
 small room no english speaking channel the lift broke down twice while we were there 
 not a worry about anything
 all was good
 no fan in bathroom rer journey from cgd to luxembourg at   nightmare to be avoided 
 this is a fake  stars hotel the bathroom do not respect any standard neither the room

 lot of things toilet was extremely small 
 the room was very small and it needs refurbishing
 the stairs when the elevator broke
 restaurant was very hot
 elevator to some rooms is slow and small
 it was raining 
 very bad wi fi
 room was a little small but this is paris

 extractor fan in bath not working could hear other guests through walls
 too old weary and tiny never four star hotel too expensive for its fercility don t be cheated by the photos
 room not been made on my last day 
 there was a strange sound the whole night maybe the heating oder something like that 
 noise of the canalisation un winter time
 staff not very friendly a smile would have been nice door to bathroom wouldn t close 
 staff was rude and unwilling to help with customer service 
 small room and bed compared to pictures bed not very comfortable 
 the elevator and at night the room was so cold
 too much noise on the top 
 little to small room and there were no hotel slippers
 typical parisian small rooms 
 no toothpaste and slippers in the room you need to ask reception for everything 
 water from the shower was pouring on the bathroom floor 
 a grab handle above the bath for safety
 everything was five star

 there was work going on outside the hotel which on the second night was very noisy

 very small bathroom 
 room was very small breakfast coffee was from a machine not great for france 
 small elevator 
 there was no real bar to speak of
 triple room was a bit on the small side as was the bathroom 
 nothing
 small rooms
 i was told we were upgraded to a superior room and the room was the size of a shoe box
 bathroom too small
 the rooms are small however it s a small price to pay for the location 
 staff not very helpful when asking for advice of where to go what to do about paris over new years eve 
 the shower curtains is too easy to leak to the bathroom floor even if you put it into the tube it still leak 
 changing the club lounge rules especially removing the complimentar access for royal ambassadors members 
 breakfast was not good i had the advocado toast and it was tasteless my daughter had the potatoe rosti and it was awful soggy and greasy 
 been stopped by the door man and asked to produce our room keys to prove we were stopping there stereotyping due to tattoos 
 well although i liked my breakfast it was not included in the room charge 
 avoid the dingy standard rooms facing the courtyard soviet style views dated and worn furnishings and subpar luxury 
 the intercontinental breakfast was kind of limited in terms of options especially for the price charged in the room the espresso machine didn t work or i couldn t find out how 
 i have stayed here occasionally over  years the breakfast which used to be quite special has now become appalling the cups and saucers have gone to be replaced by the standard holiday inn mugs the magnificent buffet has gone and replaced with meagre pre laid fruit dishes and not a lot of choice of any thing else there used to be an omelette area that s gone too for warm food you have to choose off theo randall s italian breakfast menu at mouth watering prices if the food we had was a reflection don t even bother the fried rosti tasted like a brick service too was underwhelming forgotten orders wrong orders etc and the experience all in all very poor if this is ihg s flagship hotel in london then unfortunately the  star experience they want you to have in the rest of the hotel is not matched by the breakfast i guess it has been done to make more money with fewer costs go across to the serpentine caf for a better breakfast also there are also currently no toilets on the ground floor except those at the back of the restaurant above which involve a flight of stairs for both gents and ladies so beware if you are not so mobile we will pack our bags and move on to other accommodation next time in london in the future 
 breakfast buffet has poor selection of foods and i had to pay  for the toast and butter i had breakfast wasn t included in the booking
 not enough coffee in our room only  packets so one of us couldn t have a second cup the coffee supplied at breakfast the following morning was cold and had no taste of coffee whatsoever 
 i asked for a quite room but since the room i booked was of a standard higher than regular i was given a bigger but louder room facing busy street i had to change at  am in the morning 
 the room s view location the staff should informed me during the checking in that the room will view to the intrnal yard which i may ask them for upgrade
 the bathroom requires minor maintenance repairs attention to the sink plug hole to keep water in and the hand shower in the bath needs attention due to a heavy leak when in use 
 my over all experience was just a disappointment the room quality was less than satisfactory because the view was horrid and it was poorly lit the food was below average it took an hour and twenty minutes to bring up a pair of scissors the hotel was grossly over priced for nothing other than the name it carries extremely disappointed with my stay 
 i was promised another room with a better view but when i checked later there was nothing in the system about it but when karem the night manager heard about it he immediately contacted me and came him self to my room to make it right
  bed quality is poor king size bed is simply  singles joined pillow choice and mattress is poor  no free wifi  room size not great for price
 they didnt clean my room for  days even though i called them to confirm about cleaning and tidying the room also i didnt have the clean my room door hanger nor the don t disturb one 
 i was disappointed with the spa you could only use it if you paid for a treatment we only wanted to go in for half an hour to freshen up but were unable to do so 
 they didn t clean the room one day had to call  times for someone to bring shampoo ordered croissants to my room at   am and they were dry 
 this hotel needs to match the breakfast to the quality of the hotel 
 our iron in the room didn t work not a big deal but i would have like to run it over my dress before dinner 
 i asked for early check in but the room was not ready and we had to wait a while 
 the room was below expectations although we had a superior king room which should normally have a view it overlooked the back street when we asked the staff to give us a new room the response was that the hotel was too full having booked a month earlier i dont believe they didnt give us a view room either bc of our late arrival or bc we booked through booking com for this price there are many other hotels which can provide better accomadations within the vicinity it was a definete disappointment on our part my advice is either pay a bit more and prefer  seasons or pay a bit less and stay at the hilton they re all meters away from each other having stayed in all of those this was the worst vfm 
 nothing perfect stay 
 my biggest issue with the hotel were the other guests rarely have i spent so much time around so many affected rude and ignorant individuals yes the hotel costs a few quid yes you need a bit of money to stay there but quite why people feel that makes them better then the staff working there is beyond me the rudeness and arrogance of my fellow guests was almost enough to ruin my stay 
 breakfast a little frantic restocking of bowls for fresh fruit and even butter at the breads table
 nothing none
 the rooms soundproofing is not very good because sometimes i hear sounds coming from the rooms while i am walking to my room 
 very small amount of milk in room we had to ask for coffee pods too 
 the room was too small and messy there was no cabinets to put our staff in except one tiny one and the rest were without keys to be able to open it the toilet was too small and there was a blockage in the bacenet and the water was not going down we ordered club sandwich the presentation of the sandwich was very bad as if i ordered it from a grocery and not from a famous hotel like intercontinental the taste was disgusting i swear i wanted to vomit after i ate the first bite our stay in that hotel was like a night mare and instead of the staff helping us after all what we faced after a long journey they charged us for  instead of  for that night 
 air conditioning a bit noisy 
 it was perfect for us on a one night stay
 could have been more than  nespresso pods if you are a couple it would be great to maybe have  decaf  regular pods but then again not many hotels have a nespresso machine in the room to begin with 
 bus stop is at  minutes walk to hilton h no supermarkets nearby 
 room was too hot both windows open heating low as we could get it so hot my partners asthma was set off and he was up all night as he couldn t lie down had to have water from minibar to cool himself the receptionist let us have the water and advised us that next time to call reception to help
 our room was very warm even with a c and didnt have the best view the mini bar in the fridge was very expensive   for a kitkat and  for a ml bottle of water though i guess that the majority of patrons wouldnt have to worry about the cost of water the buffet style breakfast was also a bit of a farce no information given as to whether we helped ourselves gave an order etc and there were lots of children running around also some of the staff need to be more aware of their non verbal communication 
  for two small bottles of water was a bit steep given everything else is excellent value could hear the guest next door easily at night 
 towels smells not nice receptionist not fully respect the ambassador golden card i was carried by designating low quality room 
 room was small for the price and not well fitted i e no hooks to hang things up a free bottle of water would have been a nice addition
 wifi is not free the wifi cost could have been included in the room price unfortunately i couldn t to get access to the wifi it didn t work smoothly 
 room and in particular the bathroom is a tight squeeze for  people and from this perspective i don t think the hotel offers good value for money we also experienced extremely poor service at the arches bar which given that we were out celebrating a special occasion affected our evening and would be enough to say we wont be returning 
 breakfast service and food quality not the best for this kind of hotel personal note poor phone reception  for small bottle of evian 
 service very slow we were at gin and jazz and one of the young male waiters just shrugged when we chased the already late wine earlier in the day we ordered  glasses of champagne in the bar and it took ages to arrive we ordered  glasses of champagne in our room which took  mins to arrive 
 this time i had a number of issues during my stay namely there were no slippers or bathrobe in the room there was no complimentary water the mini bar was absolutely empty all my cosmetics testers as i came for  days only were thrown away by the housekeeping
 staff is not as expected from such a great name of a hotel lack of experience lack of knowledge and i strongly believe they need so much in training 
 the rate is over priced the breakfast end at  am would be better if its  am
 overcharged by hotel on room and i ended up paying for someone else room service hotel did not care and continued to charge my card 
 poor service  days asking for something tell they send me corridors are really dirty and we adked for cleaning but they didn t in the breakfast area the treatment is really auful they way they check your room number is like a school manager wated so long to check in plus they refused to give us even hour for checkout althoug i explaned that i have doctor appointment and its hard to make it on pm but they didnt care room service is the worst 
 the bar is terrible 
 dated design within room furnishings 
 one restaurant was being renovated and out of commission 
 nothing
 no swimming pool available for guests 
 room a little small no room to put your suitcase and no rack to set it on 
 cancelled the buffett by the hotel but still keep the promotions in the room menu its bad experience didnt match the service as five star

 only complaint is bathtub to be used as a shower has a very slippery curved bottom 
 nothing

  for a tiny bag of crisps from the mini bar is steep even having regard to the usual mini bar mark up

 as i said the coffee maker didn t work apart from that i loved it 
 oh hotel is quite nice but sorry to say the location is terrible not acceptable hotel should have a shuttle for guests to take them to the closest metro station to avoid walking through the intimidating neighbourhood especially with kids 
 location was far from airport and trocadero where i wanted to mainly visit also the breakfast was rubbish hardly any variety 
 hardly any tea coffee in the room and a charge at reception for more for the coffee machine the restaurant attached was very expensive and at night there isn t anywhere nearby to eat you need to take the metro to another area 
 there are a lot of migrants around the hotel sleeping in tents because of the location you can t avoid to walk across these tents which is very scary together with your family one night we made a group of  adults at the nearest metro station to get to the hotel safely it is very crazy and it will be worse and worse 
 location is the downside there are a lot of refugees outside however it is not as severe as any of the reviews i have seen previously yes there are quite a lot and i can see how some may be slightly intimidated there are only quite a lot on the walk to the metro but we were never hassled nor stared at or made to feel uncomfortable police presence further up away from the hotel where the refugees are 
 i didn t like the fact that it s located close to the refugee asylum seeker camp
 saw a mouse small rat in or room on the last morning terrible views from the room unless you are a keen motorway and flyover spotter 
 horrible location loud discotheque right under the hotel not so great breakfast on paper plates and cups the breakfast area is in the reception no soaps in the rooms the separate toilet room is very small overall not worth the price at all 
 the location we stayed there so our son could walk to an event at salle pullman les docks 
 the location was terrible i expected more from the novotel brand i was very disappointed we booked and paid for  nights and left after one i have never felt so unsafe in my life 
 staffs 
 staff not friendly enough tea bag sugar coffee etc only one provided in the room we are two no milk at all no regular tea bag only herbal tea there is no universal wall socket to charge phone or laptop all mainland european standard hotels must be universal they forced me to buy a converter for a one night use there are plenty of things to improve standard 
 location is in a very economically depressed area there were over  homeless people sleeping near the sidewalk on the walk from the metro the rooms have paper thin walls i not only heard my neighbors conversations but also had a nightclub blaring music until  in the morning it was so bad i could hear the words to the songs with my windows closed 
 location of this hotel is very bad its not safe to travel in night time with kids in this area but metro is really close in  minute walk we use metro for all our visits 
 outside the hotel in neighbourhood there was too much mess poor housekeeping there were dozens of immigrants camps arround the hotel which is the main cause of mess in the surrounding area 
 the location of this hotel is horrible when we took the bus to the station it kept going to a bad neighborhood this hotel is located near a bridge where it is full of refugees and homeless people around when we got off the train people kept staring at us and smelled like someone peed the whole time when we walked to the hotel from the station we felt very insecure staffs were okay but i feel that they can be more helpful to those who are traveling few of them were just lazy with their answers also they don t really smile 
 the walk from the metro to the hotel is fairly intimidating due to all the tents and refugees homeless people but everyone left us alone however would not recommend for single females especially at night 
 the area around the hotel was covered with refugees and homeless while we felt sorry for their situation we didn t feel safe the hotel explained that they wouldn t be harmful to us but taxi drivers police and others around warned us to not walk around with the kids especially with luggage etc we did see a lot of cop activity and fights one evening upon returning to the hotel so this limited our ability to make the most use of the metro there we opted to taxi in most of the time 
 location has lots and lots of homeless people mostly from outside europe furthermore there is so much garbage lying around it is the worst neighbourhood i have seen in paris one does not walk outside feeling safe staff was friendly but some did not dress like a hotel employee but like tourists breakfast was not well organized dirty floor location of food not logical mediocre food paper plates 
 there are a lot of homeless people living under overhead bridges across from the hospital we mainly used uber to travel to places 
 location as such doesn t look safe specially at night lot of people homeless near by not judging 
 where do i start  horrible location even though it was walking distance from nearest metro porte de la chappelle it was a nightmare walking towards hotel as it was flooded with immigrants who have taken over the pavements trash everywhere my family was really scared at times  its not a cheap hotel during hot hot summer i expected proper working air cons we reached hotel about pm we went to bed early about   to be ready for next morning but could not sleep until midnight as it ir con was pathetic we spoke to reception but they knew it and just said they can t do anything  entrance thought it would be a decent entrance as i have seen in many hotels of same branch but it was just very average and dull and ofcourse with barely working air con 
 where should i start this hotel is rated a  star although it was a clean facility with good amenities the location was a nightmare for anyone especially families the metro station is nearby but you have to walk through a very very dirty and shady area it looks like a war zone the area was full of homeless refugees that are living under a bridge across the hotel it is not safe to walk from the metro to the hotel you have to take taxi to ensure your safety i do not recommend this hotel until this area is cleaned up and refugees are no longer misplaced i asked for a refund and management refused this hotel location put a damper our tourist experience in paris
 the hotel should have highlight more clearly the location of the hotel it is near the overhead bridge where the refugees camp is lotsa of refugees camping under the bridge however sercurity was okay as every nights when we returned late to the hotel we saw police petrol at the area basically the refugees do not disturb the area smell bad though 
 too noisy in the street by night nightclub or pub too close so could hear music until  am room too hot area and pavements around the hotel full of homeless people very dirty streets just opposite the hotel would not recommend this hotel if you travel alone by public transport as you won t feel safe to walk from tube station to the hotel unpleasant  min walk 
 bathrooms are flooding when showering design fault still they are clean and large breakfast lacks vegetables 
 terrible parking they let more cars in than there are places available which causes chaos and high risk of having car scratched location of the hotel is also terrible hundreds of homeless people sleeping just outside so going for a walk is not a good idea i do not recommend this hotel to anyone especially for families 
 the location of the hotel isn t the best
 there were no travel cots available so baby slept on single bed mattress on the floor nearby shops metro station were convenient though tent camp nearby was off putting to start with if you re paying on card with a foreign currency ask for a full receipt at checkout we re still waiting for one  weeks later and not sure if we ve been overcharged for something or if the exchange rate was not great 
 hotel is located in very rough area of the paris due to that we had to order unhealthy take aways unable to explore and experience local area travel via uber expensive compare to the trains hotel does not have a restaurant so only choice you have is to order take away or take uber to some nice area to dine toilet is as small as the size of the plane toilet 
 the breakfast is very basic and the area around the hotel is scary and dirty i was travelling with wife and  kids i was looking around us every second to make sure no one was following us the reception area is the same area as the breakfast which is something i have never seen before
 location was terrible it is across the road from a city of tents of homeless people the room was like a sauna when asked if the air con was broken we were told the only use air con in summer the staff were the opposite of a rae of sunshine especially one lady that was incapable of smiling i felt very unsafe here and chose to take taxis into paris and to train stations instead of walking with my family even the taxi drivers would say oh that part of paris is not very good 
 location was poor in a rough area with a sote for homeless people opposite breakfast selection was poor same selection every day staff were not very receptive room wasn t service properly at times and when missing items were requested they would not deliver them to the room you would have to go down and get them 
 firstly it s located in a bad place just adjacent to the hotel are makeshift tents most probably of migrant population it feels dangerous to go alone in the streets facilities were ok as it was located in bad part of city you want to rely on hotels restaurant but this hotel doesn t have an operational restaurant they claim to provide free wifi but for my entire stay there was no wifi rooms weren t cleaned properly someone s inner were lying inside my room toilet is located outside the bathroom and is one of the size to be found in aeroplane 
 location was terrible the area was unclean and smelled terrible and in front of the hotel there was a site area for homeless people this made the area very unsafe to walk through especially at night breakfast was basic to say the least not many options hardly any vege options hotel staff were not very accommodating to any requests and when something was missing in the room due to poor room service i e no tea bags or no milk or no cups no soap the hotel expected you to come to reception to collect the missing items rather than bring them to the room 
 the room was so hot i could not sleep overnight also the wifi was so weak i use my data the location was quite unsafe 
 room appears clean but smelly bad odour in corridors as well breakfast was just as bad as not much to choose from parking was expensive and difficult to get in and out the area where the hotel was situated seems dodgy could not wait to get out of that place 
 location is really rough and nothing really around we took uber everywhere to avoid walking around the area as it was really off putting had a lot of beggars really nice hotel don t know why they would put it in that location
 the second bed was a bit decieving from the listing we thought we were getting a  bedroom suite when in fact the bedrooms are just separated by a curtain 
 causing a lot of inconvenience to us and my friend again requested next day but invain had to come back spoiling our trip due to hotel zero cooperation no refund terrible 
 the location makes you feel unsecure there were a lot of homeless or refugees making homes in tents along the only route from the subway station to the hotel the hotel is also near to the central waste collection center which you must pass by onroute to the subway 
 the location and neighborhood is less to be desired graffiti everywhere dirty strong smell of urine reffugee camp under flyover please look after your belongings when approached by beggers when traveling at night use vtcs type very reasonable price
 two of my friends had money stolen from our safe and staff showed no interest in helping us one lady on reception actually laughed and seemed to think we were making it up surrounding area didn t feel entirely comfortable or safe as there is a big group of homeless people area not well lit and we struggled to figure out how to walk there from the tube station although in daylight this wasn t a problem but there is a very busy road to cross with no traffic lights in parts
 area in which hotel is located is not the best one 
 nothing
 the carpet had holes all throughout it where people had dropped cigerrettes on the floor it wasnt very pleasant to walk over also asked restaurant staff if they could blend a banana and milk for my son and we was told nope no explanation why 
 location though not the best is alright and not at all as bad as some visitors find it 
 we have  persons when i booking on this website they described this suite have two bedrooms but in fact only use transparent curtain to separate bed and lounge where put small sofa bed it is totally wrong info from booking com so we have to take one more suite when we checking in the outside of the hotel is terrible dirty and not safe feeling but near to airport and exhibition it is good for me 
 restock tea and coffee facilities have proper cups for tea and coffee not paper cups have a separate desk for reception separate to shop and bar as there was always people at the desk buying things and not enough staff to attend to customers staff not very friendly no greetings unless you greet them first ironing facility only on one level should be available in every room our pre arranged transport waited for us outside and we waited inside despite front desk knowing that there was transport waiting for for customers and us telling them we were waiting for transport to pick us up we had to go outside and asked the driver who had been waiting for us for a while when we noticed he was there very poor service 
 the area where hotel is situated looked a bit out of city it is near near motorways and recycling facility but then everything else about the hotel covered up for this tiny little shortfall 
 the location was terrible it was too far away from the sights area is run down hotel wasn t easy to find even with sat nav and parking proved difficult to get in and out breakfast in the hotel was poor quality runny snotty eggs were the only cooked item the same food was brought out that had been out the day before the same stale quiche had been put out all three mornings i was there 
 the price is more relative to the location than the hotel although the location is ok in relation to getting places in the city relatively quickly we didn t feel the most comfortable walking between the metro station and the hotel as the surrounding area were very run down and did not feel particularly safe at times a small problem was also the fact that we chose a non smoking room on arrival but were given a smoking room this didn t turn out to be that much of a problem though as it did not smell or effect our effect the hotel really but it may not be the best for others 
 as a woman travelling on my own i thought the walk the metro wasn t pleasant i was also disappointed that the english language tv service in the room did not work as advertised 
 the staff were super rude and not helpful at all half of the things in the room didn t work airconditioner fridge microwave when we asked the staff to get them fixed they were pretty nonchalant about it and didn t really sound that interested in it eventually ofcourse nothing got fixed also please note that you ll be staying at the very edge of paris in an area full of drug addicts and some other unpleasant creatures better get a room in the centre if you can afford it 
 if you need to take the elevators you just need to wait for the cleaners they keep it busy doesn t matter if you are in rush
 very bad location in a really insecure and unsafe neighborhood never even try to book there there were people using drugs just outside the hotel we tried to cancel our booking when we saw the hotel but they d dn t let us the staff was not helpful and grumpy on top of this the tv was broken and there were peanuts behind it they probably d dn t clean t properly also there was a constant smell n the elevators later on we moved to a different place we were told that the hotel was located in the sketch est neighborhood of paris right next to the dumping ground a big no if you want to stay safe 
 slightly small reception basic breakfast parking not free although you pay a special rate of  euro all day 
 air con didn t work properly they threw away my water bottle which was on the desk 
 parking is super expensive hotel staff really dishonest we had several times random expenses always ask for the detail of your bill 
 i booked for  guest but only supplied a bottle of water and tea for  person when explaining this to the staff the manager was extremely rude and disrespectful immediately she would benefit from doing a customer service course as the treatment my friends and i received was one of the worst i have ever experienced i would never stay here again and i would not advise anyone else to stay here 
 a lot of reviews talk about feeling threatened or intimidated by the area certainly if  year old girls and old women begging scares you avoid st denis is not the nicest of places but convenient for what i needed avoid the scrambled egg truly awful but good selection otherwise for breakfast i and others took food away for later and no comment was made by staff take coffee with you not a lot by the kettle 
 the toilet extractor did not work and the toilet had a bad smell there is no aircon lucky for us it was cool weather but i can imagine in hot months it can get very uncomfortable the area is not safe we walked to the metro station and nearly got attacked by a very aggressive black man that approached us in a very suspicious and aggressive manner and swore at us we just kept walking faster and went into the metro station it was very scary as we had our  month old baby with us we are so grateful the man did not hurt us 
 paying extra for parking the room was so warm we had to keep a window open so was noisy at night as it s located so close to a lot of roads lots of people begging and living rough outside
 the surrounding area was at first sight alarming with rubbish strewn all around there also appeared to be a number of refugees and vagrants begging in the area which again at first was a little daunting 
 i could not fault anything 
 the manager of hotel wants to pay all the money there but in greece there is not the opportinity to take more than  euros per week and she didnt accept the card which we have already sent in order to pay the rooms 
 the location was not the best close to a metro line but a bit of a strange area
 the nearby garbage collection facility was not somewhere i want to see in paris although i did not experience any bad situation the neigborhood does not look secure 
 is the worst possible location the hotel is in a run down area right next to a homeless shelter not great at all when your girlfriend is frightened to walk from the hotel to the tube station 
 the location is fine if you re driving or getting a cab or uber but as a pedestrian it s a nightmare if you don t know that area there is a metro station nearby but it is really hard to reach it you need to do a huge detour to be able to cross the high traffic streets around the hotel or maybe there s a secret passage that i missed who knows in any case after walking  minutes i felt stupid and just called a cab instead of taking the metro 
 poor housekeeping service housekeeping staff were not able to understand english difficult to explain your needs 
 the bad part is the location a taxi driver was in shock when he brought us back from the centre of paris he said the area was very dangerous and it felt like that too 
 this is no fault of the hotel or staff but immediately outside the hotel were people sleeping rough in vast numbers and therefore felt very uncomfortable and unsafe it was at times like walking through a war zone 
 just the neighborhood is not so nice the way walikg to the metro we pass on places with garbage everywhere 
 location of hotel is not the best hence the reason there s a security guard
 however the way to that about  minutes walks isn t the most pleasure one with some poor families living under the bridge in front of the hotel my family and i didn t had any problem but you you have concerns with security i don t recomend 
 the location i would suggest the hotel to put a tip on their website on how to reach the hotel from the metro station when we first arrived we obviously have no idea which route we should take to reach the hotel and thus ended up walking pass a very dodgy rough and unsafe area more so when you walked at night
 the location is very poor there are homeless people living on the streets between the subway station and the hotel no taxis at the subway station you have to walk through a rough neighborhood there are prostitutes in same area saw some fighting going on so we changed the street we walked on the view out the back from our suite was a vacated crumbling set of buildings with graffiti etc no eifel tower views from my window 
 location felt unsafe walking back from the metro at night under the underpass would not recommend this fine if you re travelling in a car as this hotel is right on the edge of intersecting motorways not good if you re using it as a base to explore paris attractions stay somewhere else 
 nothing to say all was good
 as you may have read from other reviews this hotel is not in the heart of town although it s close and you do walk through a less privileged part of paris it is not far to get into town once you reach porte de la chapelle metro station but it is a decent  minute walk to the metro in a less than picturesque part of town this may be unacceptable to some people but we managed let s just say i wouldn t feel comfortable walking back from the station after dark unless i am in a group of  guys there are no restaurants takeaway food outlets nearby which was annoying so if you want to venture around porte de la chapelle metro station we found a great cheap and nasty pizza place near there gym needs to have some weights and a bench aircon was not cold enough for us and we would have liked some bowls and utensils and proper cups vs plastic cups i suggest you look on google earth google maps before booking if you are a bit precious with where you stay 
 very bad service the door card did not work twice have to go down from th floor to the service disks staff members don t feel any sorry about the door card did not work no sorry don t care customer s feeling

 room to small which was difficult to navigate with  large suitcases our room wasn t made up till about   in the afternoon even though we had been out for at least four hours earlier in the day 
 in relation to the view from the room was originally given a room in the basement window faced a wall asked to move which they kindly facilitated and got a slightly smaller room on the th floor so i could see the sky but was looking out on a flat roof as they said the hotel was busy there wasn t much choice so i was happy that they moved us 
 very small single room and an even smaller shower ft x ft square difficult to get in and out at my age  i am glad i was not obese to get to my room was by lift and stairs not easy with a suitcase staff helped
 the rooms were quite small even though we had a club room in particular the bathroom it was really small and the sink you couldn t even get your head near to brush your teeth and the tap that was on the sink was huge 
 nothing not to like
 we were not happy with the room it very small fortwo people it was difficult moving around each other as well has having our things in the way 
 there was an issue with pre payment authorizations however we did contact the hotel directly and they resolved the problem promptly
 none of the windows in the hotel open which can be a little stuffy in the rooms this isn t down the the hotel though as the building is listed and they can not change the windows 
 we were booked into a superior room but the bathroom was accessed down steep stairs and that small that it was in my opinion dangerous 
 the furniture needs a bit of renovation wanted to have their breakfast but the kitchen smell was all over the dining room so went to out 
 views from windows always ask for rooms with the view on main street otherwise will get noisy neighbors and some kind of warehouse that starts business   in the morning 
 i m glad that i booked this room for  instead of close to  on the hotel s website 
 the only thing that bothered me was the size of the room with  people you couldn t pass each other that said all the good things and especially the location compensated this 
 the room was tiny for the price the room was only big enough room for a single bed and someone to stand next to the bed the window wasn t much bigger than a computer monitor and was in the top corner of the room similar to what i d imagine a prison to have i was on the very top floor it felt a bit like an attic room great staff but just wouldn t stay again as i wasn t comfortable in the room 
 room was so small and bathroom was even smaller showering resulted in everything in sight being drenched no workable shower screen and pathetic shower headlike 
 the reception are not polite and some of them don t know what to do when they meet up with any kind of problems definitely i ll never ever stay there again even still water is not available in this hotel when you ask reception that can i have a bottle of water you will got right away this answer we have got glass in the room and you can drink tab water believe me never try tab water tasty like stream water honestly it was terrible staying even if you want to leave one day early they will never refund your money back you have to pay exactly how many days you think at beginning 
 could not get the tv to work not overly concerned room small but i guess that was to be expected and sufficient these are only minor items
 the bathroom was tiny you could sit on the loo clean your teeth and enjoy a shower all at the same time not enough room to swing a cat i had to use the public toilets on returning to the hotel to collect my luggage and unfortunately it was down a flight of stairs and wasn t clean it smelled of stale urine not good 
 the room was tiny which was a surprise since it is not a cheap hotel we were told we were given an upgrade i cannot imagine what we were supposed to have also the shower screen was ridiculously skinny which defeated its purpose the bathroom mirror has a function whereby a part of it does not steam up the demisted part was too high up the mirror for me to see myself thus defeating the object once again there was very little thought put into these issues on the whole i feel we would have got more for our money at premier inn 
 liked everything 
 i paid for club rate and the size of the room was tiny couldn t properly fit  suitcases in it additionally there was only a really narrow small window a friend who paid for the same rate got a basement room with a terrible smell the room bathroom was not well cleaned and necessities such as shampoos soaps etc were not re filled added during our stay i am pretty sure that sheets were not changed either during our  day stay the carpet was poorly laid on top of an older one in a very obvious way staff was not consistent with clients for example the same request book a room for an extra night had  different responses from  different staff members we cannot please book through the website and yes sure 
 the room doors don t have any padding to slow them down so during the evening everyone coming and going sounded like they were slamming their doors 
 hot sandwich from room service was cold tiny room but this is typical for london especially a single room 
 service from reception entered my room without announcing and knocked on my door at   at night and cost of breakfast 
 the room was very small and it was an upgrade i am a tiny person and i felt a little clausterphobic in the room the bathroom was incredibly small i would not recommend this hotel to someone who is on the larger side 
 sizes of room and toilets 
 the room had no windows which i know the hotel had no choice on but still did feel a bit suffocating small issue though not a deal breaker and if they could only find a way to fit a mini bar in the room 
 the room was the smallest room i had ever seen it was a struggle to manage to clamber around the bed and not at all like the advertised photos the was a chair in the room pushed under the table but as the end of the bed was behind the chair it was not possible to pull the chair out to sit on it was then a hinderance makibg it more difficult to get around the other side of the bed 
 the rooms were tiny this was a deal breaker i do not recall seeing sizes when i booked but i acknowledge they may have been listed at that time i know they are listed now because i looked it up if we could have pivoted and stayed somewhere else we would have but it was not practical from what i can see all the hotels in this area had similarly but slightly larger rooms the single induced claustrophobia we usually all meet in a room to discuss plans etc that was impossible in this hotel 
 they tried to move us to another hotel citing maintenance issues we refused and a room suddenly became available the rooms were not as grand as the reception area 
 being double booked and asked to leave being rebooked into someone else s room and receiving no compensation for time lost and stress and inconvenience 
 the shower sprayed water everywhere 
 rooms a little small but to be expected for the location and price otherwise fantastic 
 noisy both out on the street and in the hotel double bed was two single beds together 
 deluxe twin booked a big deal made on checking in that we were getting upgraded to superior a bit insulting when we saw the tiny room with the twin beds with no gap between them if that was superior i d hate to see deluxe what on earth is standard like 
 nothing to fault
 our room it was the smallest room i have ever stayed in it was not suitable for two people or fit for purpose i booked a superior double room it was not a double and definitely not superior i had to lay on the bed if my husband wanted use the bathroom i have stayed in many hotels including in paris and this is the smallest by far when we arrived at the hotel approx  pm there were people in front of us at the desk who where been called taxis in order for them to be moved to a sister hotel due to maintenance issues which can only be construed as an overbooking issue also we had to wait for our room to be fixed cleaned as it was not ready when we arrived so late in the day although we did receive a free drink in the bar for our inconvenience for the price we paid it was not value for money 
 the room was very small and quite shabby and tired looking the actual building itself is beautiful but the decor is very tired looking and scruffy in places our tiny room looked over the back of the hotel and was of rubbish skips that had overflowed onto the path so not very pleasant to look at in view of all this we felt it was very overpriced 
 the room was on the th floor tucked away at the end of a corridor by the staircase therefore quite noisy until late at night the room was the tiniest room that i have ever stayed in and i travel a lot to london and abroad the regular size double bed filled the entire room with hardly any space around it to manoeuvre i literally had to shimmy down the side of the bed to get into it and also in order to reach the bathroom the room was advertised as a superior double but in my experience it was only standard and due to the small capacity and lack of space would be better utilised for single occupancy the photographs within the booking details are misleading 
 when i landed in london i received a call from grande royale hyde park booked via your website they informed me that they had maintenance issues and that they transferred me to another hotel with the same rating after visiting another hotel paddington hotel which was more distant from the hyde park and looked like it should have   star rating i went back to the grand royal and demanded the room magically the room was available about  smaller in size than the one i booked towels with hair on sorry its far from  star disaster 
 the only problem i felt was the double room was more like a single room so when i asked  be moved they were helpful  accomodete us with another room 
 by room could have been a little cleaner there were stains on the walls and on the lampshades 
 the room wasn t ready when we arrived fair play we were given complimentary drinks while we waited it s just a bit irritating paying all that money i wouldn t then expect to wait plus my friend is heavily pregnant so that made it more annoying and difficult for her after a long journey 
 hotel was overbooked due to multiple people booking same day on booking com hotel went above and beyond to accommodate us so all ended well 
 hotel is a little tired in some public areas that need re painting 
 some of the back stairs to the rooms could do with a bit of sprusing up bar area also needs some touching up 
 double room was a little cramped and would have preferred a bit more room but we had all the facilities we needed for a short  night stay 
 our room was incredibly small the hotel rooms look lovely in the photographs but in reality seem a little tired and run down we paid a very reasonable rate for the room through booking com which was reserved several months in advance but we noticed that the general prices closer to the date were hugely inflated at prices that could not be justified for what you actually get also the communal toilets in basement not great when group of rowdy young men burst in when wife alone 
 we had booked one night in a twin room but were told on arrival that they only had doubles staff offered a discounted second night as compensation but we were unable to take them up on this so still ended up paying the not insignificant full cost of the room for an uncomfortable night s sleep sharing a bed
 tiny room and bathroom so small that the door couldn t open properly due to toilet behind it lots of noise coming from outside and view of bins and rubbish from room window 
 rooms are very small could barely move around we weren t in it all that much but make sure you pay attention to the size of the room you are booking 
 couch pull out bed the mattress was so old it sank to the middle and i had to hang on to the furniture beside the bed to pull myself out also slept for the week with the bars under the mattress poking me in the back and leg asked for different mattress but wasn t available needed to just buy a new mattress and throw that one away the main bed was wonderful but i wasn t the one sleeping there unfortunately 
 nothing really i was very happy with it 
 we booked as it was stated that they had parking available which they didn t when we got to the property they had no twin rooms despite this being what we booked 
 my room had an insect problem but that was quickly resolved it s other things such as the drapes hanging off the rod and the dirty wallpaper and carpeting that were concerning the shower sprayed the whole bathroom impossible to contain without a bigger glass panel or shower curtain it is a lovely building but needs some upkeep inside 
 i paid for a superior room and the room was the size of a small walk in wardrobe the shower didnt have a curtain soo the floor gets completely soaked their large towels are big enough to dry a young child it was ridiculous
 the room was on the small size as well as the en suite did not see a tip box for the staff as i would have most definitely liked to have given the staff something they were absolutely wonderful which made up for the room being on the small size 
 good location with easy access to queensway underground station although our room had been recently refurbished and comfortable it was referred to as a club room but was very small friendly and helpful staff but the property could do with a major makeover 
 bedroom and bathroom where on the small side but we didn t really need any more space as it was only a short stay
 twin room is tiny with very little natural light no hotel parking available 
 the size of the bedroom super small bathroom shower far too small no possibility to open windows for fresh air what happened in case of fire looks obvious they have been maximising the profit by reduced rooms size 
 small rooms noisy air con units little sleep due to noisy neighbouring buildings room at the back of hotel overlooking the bins
 do not test the fire alarms without informing arriving new guests that are jet lagged and sleeping this was extremely upsetting 
 towels were small room was a bit on the tight side provided shampoo and body wash smelled good but left odd feeling on hands 
 tiny room bathroom very small shower size the smallest i have every been in fridge not cold iron and ironing board cheap and barely worked complimentary water  x small bottles not complimentary no notification of such 
 staff friendly very clean and a walk back in time to style of the communal areas 
 i noticed the lack of a face cloth in the bathroom i guess this is not a british convention 
 to be honest i was disgusted with the hotel my friend was too big for bed ad he s   and the bathroom was a joke tempted to ask for my money back 
 the shower cubicle was very slippery and no hand rail 
 toilet was too close to wall almost had to sit sideways shower cubicle was too small i m not large but it was all too close for comfort 
 there wasn t anything i did not like
 the exceptionally small bedrooms a double room can nearly fit two people and two suitcases  people cannot walk around the room at the same time 
 bedrooms a little small
 tony rooms 
 the toilet flush did not work properly the sink could not be reached as it was so small cold tap could not be opened without excessive force
 very but i mean very small rooms tiny bathrooms in my room the window was stuck and not open even a little
 noisy neighbours and banging doors but the staff handled the problem beautifully once i d rung through to reception and also the manager spotted the notes when i was checking out and asked if the problem had been dealt with 
 room was slightly small but given the location and ambience of the hotel was prepared to accept that as a small negative 
 the rooms are small but it is central london 
 small rooms specially when have babystroller had stairs in the hallway and in the room not ideal for us 
 small bathroom but was enough for the stay 
 poor room facilities says on their website you have an iron in the room but you have to request it rooms are tiny for a  star to not have any room service is poor has a fridge which was empty no guest service book had to guess how to even call reception i travel a lot for work and would not go to this hotel again 
 double booked at hotel and hotel has yet to refund me me the cancelled booking have disputed double charges with my credit card company and the issue has yet to be resolved in my favor 
 the first room allocated was a lower ground room which was dark and very small we relocated to room  which was the same size as the first ie very small we hardly had room to move around in what was advertised as a super delux room both rooms were smaller than you get in a modern budget hotel at twice the cost room  did not have a ventilation system in the toilet this was corrected after i mentioned it also the complete sink tap system had come away from the wall i guess it did work 
 wifi is too bad i was at room  club room most of the time i could not go through this is quite important for me traveling for business otherwise i have to use my local carrier which cost me a lot as it is international 
 there was nothing to dislike 
 it is obviously not the hotel s fault but there are major building works adjoining and opposite which could be going on for some time some of the rooms are small and a bit claustrophobic 
 for a superior  star room it was small with a microscopic en suite acceptable but disappointing for the price breakfast should have been included better value breakfast was found close by try the italian gardens in hyde park 
 the rooms were very small just a bed and enough room to walk around it good thing we didn t need to spend a lot of time inside our hotel rooms other than to sleep 
 the only down side was the room size it was certainly adequate for one person travelling light and staying for one night for two people staying two nights there was very little storage and hanging space for clothes it was clean and it was comfortable 
 my sister will soon be having hip surgery and getting up the steps to enter the hotel was difficult for her as there was no handicapped access 
 i need to cancel my last day booking due to schedule change but was rejected by booking com and hotel disappointed with the poor flexibility 
 rooms very small bathroom tiny but very clean and modern hotel is very old and needs new carpets wonderful wood decor but needs refinished it could be a beauty i probably would not go back 
 the size of the room could be greater but our criticism on this point is minor you could arrange for a common pot for tips the staff was excellent but we were told that one only pays tips to a given person for services rendered e g porter i wanted my tip to be placed for the benefit of all the staff 
 the room was so tiny we could hardly believe it even after an upgrade to a bigger room it was smaller than our bedroom at home the view from our room overlooked a backstreet loading bay for a nearby restaurant takeaway which instantly took the edge off having a room upgrade i couldn t help thinking what view we would have had from the smaller room the pictures online of the reception lounge area are bang on it looks lovely however the rooms are nowhere near what is shown the advertised rooms must cost an absolute fortune i ve spent over  less per night in london for bigger rooms better views and the same facilities the overall experience nowhere near justifies the cost 
 all good
  close from the tube station but a little bit hard to find out the location surrounding by houses  window cannot be opened so hot 
 rooms on floor  a little small but adequate 
 we had two rooms and we would have preferred they be on the same floor however this was a last minute reservation and it was not possible this was completely understandable 
 the room was a little cramped and there was no iron ironing board apart from that amazing 
 i feel the breakfast should be included in the room rate its an expensive hotel to start with 
 we had a superior queen room and to say it was a tight fit for two people would be an understatement the room was so small you could not actually turn around on one side of the bed i have a bruise on my arm from whacking it a few times on the handle of the closet as it was so narrow going into the bathroom and out the door 
 the hotel was a total disgrace in all aspects my bag in the luggage cart was stolen right under their nose when i was checking in what s more disappointing is the hotel s response regarding the incident i had little to no help from them even after complaining about their poor service the hotel only helped call a cab but then abandoned us at a police station far away around midnight before leaving the hotel told us that they will provide roundtrip service even after requesting for pickup from hotel twice no one came to get us after the incident no employees or mangers reached out to us as if nothing occurred we had to insist managers to meet us when they did they were neither condolence with our loss nor try to help us in anyway they were utterly rude and did nothing but wasted our precious vacation time as guests of the hotel the hotel has responsibility to ensure our safety including our belongings even if hotel can t replace my stuff at least could offer help in any way rather than being immature and heartless 
 not sure about shower screen it wasn t big enough to stop the floor from getting wet
 we booked a twin room only to arrive and find out that there were no twin rooms available at the end the receptionist could find a room in a sister hotel nearby which apparently was bigger than the one we booked thus they wanted us to move again the next day which we refused since we had unpacked everything we booked a club room with club lounge access from booking com however we found out that the club lounge was open to the guest only upon availibility at least one of the days the lounge was busy all day and not on use for the guests 
 tiny bath area and the bathroom could have been cleaner 
 the room was extremely small and for  persons with luggage and shopping the space was not enough 
 small room for two people and bathroom very small
 unfortunately the rooms were very small but to be expected in buildings built in that era nicely updated bathrooms tv etc 
 the size of room and the mattress was so bad and cheap the house made was bother guest on morning even i past do not distribute
 the bedroom sizes 
 none
 i found the room dated not very clean fitted furniture hanging off the wall and a smell coming from the toilet drain i can t see how this hotel is rated as four star possibly two star and that s pushing it
 room was small and not enough wardrobe space also stairs from room door to room itself meant difficulty negotiating round bed to get to bathroom could easily have an accident during the night and fall 
 nothing
 room mattress water leaking the shameful behavior of one of the reception staff and the alternate manager at the time of my reservation knew what i mean 
 the rooms are quite small but adequate for two people bathrooms are very small 
 room was a little on the small side
 the room described as superior double was in fact a single room with a double bed in it touching the wall on one side and only six inches from the other the head of the bed was against the wall with approx two feet at the bottom 
 rooms were smaller than expected and from about am there was banging coming from above my room i was told this was the restaurant so i cannot recommend this hotel they did offer a  refund but this didn t make up for the unwanted alarm call of banging chairs 
 the hotel checked someone else into my room kept me waiting while they checked their mistakes and then didn t offer or provide an upgrade by way of apology 
 slight issue with the tv as could not receive all channels but staff member assisted though was unable to completely solve the problem 
 the room was tiny to the point that you had to step aside for the other person to move and the windows wouldn t open not even slighly to get some fresh air something totally unhealthy 
 i was disappointed that there was no dinner service i would have enjoyed dining in style in that lovely room 
 the room was very small the shower was poor the breakfast was to expensive the channels weren t working in the tv i won t be staying in this hotle again
 maybe not understanding why booking breakfast at reception attracted a  discount why make paying guests jump through a hoop fair enough for non guest but the hotel has already collected  so not a customer friendly policy does the hotel need the  difference that much 
 it was located further out than we expected had to take taxis to get to places not a lot of restaurants to chose from and did not like the idea of our room in the basement 
 room a bit small
 noise from construction work across the road in the morning
 no a c very hot breakfast a bit high but good
 the room was a little on the small size and was difficult to get around the bed to get into it 
 bathroom was minute my partner who is ft  struggled to fit in the shower i m ft  and couldn t move and it was a complementary upgrade i wouldn t want to see the standard accommodation bathroom 
 we thought the room was a bit smaller than we expected but nevertheless was very clean and comfortable and had everything we needed for our one night stay and did not include things we didn t need or use such as posh note pads and mini fridges a trouser press for the men would have been useful after all there was a hair dryer for the ladies 
 the surroudings are dirty looking out from room there is no light above the dressing table in room no  also there is no shuttle van service to heathrow 
 our bedroom could have been a bit bigger sometimes it was difficult to move about 
 our room was smaller than i expected one side of the double bed is along the wall so we could not comfortably open both our suitcases 
 the room size was ridiculously small it was actually a free upgrade so i would not want to our original pn room i literally have bruises from banging into things 
 i left a top behind rang the hotel told them what happened receptionist took all my details promised to ring back that was  weeks ago not good 
 room overlooked bins at back but hey one nite buinsess no problem
 room is not big few light 
 the room is too small we booked a deluxe twin the reality was different from the photos there was hardly any room for suitcases the bed sheets were dirty such basic necessities as toiletries and toilet paper were often missing when we came back to the hotel in the evening the shower hose was too short and my height is only   m so if you are tall it ll be very uncomfortable you can hear the floors creaking and squeaking from all the rooms around and above 
 the rooms were very small specially for a  hotel the photos cheat a little 
 the rooms are small 
 as above
 the room is a little bit small than what i had initially thought i travelled on my own and didnt spend much time in the room so its alright however it would be a lot better if its just slightly bigger and i have a bit more floor space 
 the beds sagged a lot 
 the room was not what i expected from the booking and a hotel of this nature the manager has been directly reviewing the concerns and contacted me directly 
 even with a double upgrade room super small double bed for  used to  queen or a king but europe london different
 there was nothing that didn t come up to description or photographs 
 view from the room was of piles of rubbish bins so we were unable to open the window during the night the bathroom had a very very small shower which was not very pleasant to use 
 the room was a bit small so it lacked a proper place to work on the laptop but sitting in the beautiful lounge makes up for this 
 rooms are absolutely nothing like the pics on the net and are grubby with dirty marks on walls and switches heating didn t work in room review would be better if the hotel managed expectations with realistic images of rooms 
 larger room but accepted it was in london
 the room was one of the tiniest i ve ever seen there was mold on the bathroom ceiling and you can hear noise from the hallways and nearby rooms on one occasion our fresh towels smelled like feet 
 bar was beautiful staff member behind it needs extra training in customer service 
 not sure i can find a fault 
 the cleaning of the room while proper seemed a bit sloppy she must have broken a glass while cleaning because we found broken glass on the floor just once 
 we did not like the exit of the queensway subway station the sizes of some rooms were very tiny 
 room was a little cramped 
 the original room i was placed in i could touch both sides of the room the room smelt like it hadnt been aired for weeks and when changing the size of the room improved but it was still slightly run down for what you would consider a  star hotel 
 creaky floorboards i know to be expected thin walls small rooms at night our neighbours snored very loudly and watched fv in the hours that we should all be asleep 
 had breakfast in room for  but sent on  plates and wasnt the best quality also a room for  was double and pull out sofa but no bedding pillows duvet etc provided on request though 
 steps down into a tiny room with creaky floors too hot window sealed shut and air con not effective 
 nothing really to complain about breakfast is on an expensive side but we did not have it so cannot judge quality 
 the elevator is too small for the hotel s size on the other hand at least they have one 
 our room was a bit small though well equipped and comfortable 
 misleading photos th rooms are far too small by  is hardly a room to relax in there is no heating the day time this hotel should only be rated a  stra and not  which is misrepretations of the hotel i would not use it again 
 we genuinely loved everything about our experience 
 check in was very slow and although very clean the room was very small and the shower room was worse that being in a cupboard the basin also was leaking over the floor overall not that comortable 
 old blood on the duvet told them about it and got it changed but thought it was a bit odd upgraded room to club and was very small 
 bathroom was small but adequate for our needs 
 very small rooms some rooms have no windows and some have windows but no view there is a wall blocking any possible view 
 the bathroom in the room we were moved to although we went from a superior room to a club room because of maintenance work the bathroom was   smaller and no bath the wash basin was a cup with a tap 
 there wasn t anything i didn t like about this stay or hotel 
 the tea coffee cups were too small in the room 
 experimentalist outside the window violent custody dumping warning 
 rooms can do with some tlc and are much smaller than anticipated room  was quite warm and the split system would blow warm when placed on cool and cool when placed on warm bathroom ventilation is poor also cleaning staff half heartedly serviced our room on two occasions if you need a taxi do not use the hotels affiliate service they will rip off any unnasuming tourist  for a four minute car journey i don t think so 
 the rooms were small in size and had a congested feel not enough space for suitcases and to move around i was initially in a double room then upgraded to a king size room thinking that it would be more spacious but it wasn t 
 the room was smaller than a closet it was not reflective of the website and descriptions another guest checked out for same reasons as i was trying to revolve the room issue no ventilation in room 
 the hotel room was tiny and couldn t have a nice shower without banging my body against the shower couldn t get  people in the bathroom
 deluxe double room too small for  people impossible to fit in zero room for suitcases  tiny wardrobe ridiculous
 there was no chain on room  the deadlock was broken just spun around there is no shower door or curtain in the bathroom the front desk staff seemed a little inexperienced 
 room size even club room very compact with only one chair for two guests other one had to sit on bed facing wall 
 personalen var tyv rr inte serviceminded loj och l ngsam gick inte att best lla allt som fanns p menyn g ller b de mat och dryck fint l ge vid hyde park litet rum och badrum 
 the bed was uncomfortable and the shower did not have a screen so the floor ended up soaked after every shower also the tv was quite old and did not have the option to plug a usb in to watch movies etc 
 size of the room for a  is way too small we requested a twin beds room and there was no space left in the room bathroom is tight but has quality features 
 room was too small to move around in breakfast was too expensive for what it was you can get the exact same breakfast at a premier inn 
 we where basically in the basement very small room and which was very worn out and it did feel exactly how i imagined a cell would feel like
 we had to change room as the first was so disappointing our second room was hot the air conditioning didn t work and the window could not be opened we had a very uncomfortable sleepless night 
 the room was small the bed was hard and there was a split in the carpet were it had been joined together 
 i wish there had been space for a mini fridge the room was a tight fit for one adult and child also i m sure it was a fluke but found evidence that the room had not been vacuumed from the guest who was there before us she must have had a lot of hair 
 extremely small rooms even for london standards especially for the price average customer service difficult to get to from airport via public transport 
 the staff are completely unprofessional no customer service experience what so ever i called in before to confirm my staying and the lady that answer my call has no experience on how to answer my question and no telecommunication skills awful 
 room is quite small for the price 
 room very small had a single bed and the room had a space remaining of less than a metre between bed and wall 
 the room was incredibly small very disappointing no room for suit cases no table or chairs my dog has a larger kennel 
 very little we would have liked more space in our room
 very small room created in the attic space with a very small window so glad it was only to sleep in the room was quiet but the skylight lets you know when its raining 
 bedroom was rather small didn t matter for me on this trip as i was barely there but a longer stay might have been awkward
 our room was small moist and very cold the bathroom was cold had no bath tub and the paint on the walls were worn down the view was non existent
 the rooms are very small if your used to big american hotels this will shock you but for london it s what to be expected the bed was genuinely a bit small to be called a double though will be staying here again but will pay extra for bigger room bed 
 wish we were there for longer it was over too quickly 
 i have booked a superior double room at grand royale what i have got was a two class single room in a bed and breakfast location called shaftesbury hyde park international this is a bed breakfast location without any comfort the room was a single not a double room not very clean so small that i was unable to open my suitcase the heating system was off and the stuff needed two hours to put on the heating system so i have booked a superior double room at grand royale london hyde park a four stars hotel what i and another couple have got was a second standard bed breakfast two stars single room in a bed breakfast location in the same street this for a proice for a four stars hotel this is an illegal practice of the hotel which should have consequences 
 window in the room didn t open bed was much too soft the heating went on in the middle of the night we were boiling didn t sleep at all 
 cleaner was smoking in hallway office leaking into hallway and room a little a bit old fashioned particulalry lounge areas need updating would like more food restaurant options
 the room was very small very and it was a dusty 
 rooms very small first room we were shown had a flight of stairs just inside the door extremely dangerous 
 the room we expected was not available alternative was small cramped and noisy with outlook over dirty buildings described as superior deluxe not in our view 
 no one pointed out where the bar area was in case wanted a drink before going out not even sure if there was one one equally no one pointed to us where the restaurant was to see if we could be tempted to eat in so not a real negative just a missed opportunity 
 room was small alright for a single person but tough to share there was a desk with a chair i could not use because it was tight against the bed 
 dust behind bed on carpet 
 the staff wouldn t let my boss his guests vacate the hotel until they had paid for breakfast which i had arranged to settle using the corporate credit card the staff said they couldn t take payment over the phone useless 
 the room was cold at the window had to pull a curtain between the bed area and the sitting area there was no heating in that area would not stay in this room again
 however i was not aware that my room would be so small and in the basement of the hotel there were no photos of such small rooms on website
 the size of the room and taking the   out of our account to put it back in  days later staff knocking on the door at   to say you are checking out today
 everything else very poor value for money the bathroom was so small that my friend and i who both have mobility problems dare not use the bath or shower in case we could not get out again we were told that we had an upgrade to a larger room how small would the other room have been would never go there again 
 there was nothing we disliked 
 i am a frequent traveling and this is unfortunately the worst hotel i have ever stayed in extremely small room one way in and one way out floor in reception area needs lots of love misleading based on images shown on the website wifi was miserable
 we usually book a delux or club room at this hotel but our funds were a bit tighter for this visit so we booked a superior standard room it was adequate for just going to bed in however the bathroom which only had a shower cubicle some have baths with built in baths our bathroom was ridiculously small no elbow room at all there was significant corrosion under the sink on the fittings and the wall was pitted beneath one of the switches in the bedroom area the heater was effective but very noisy and our window was rather drafty our room was to the rear of the hotel and by am we could hear the faint sound of the tube station below the hotel even on the rd floor 
 inadequate heating had to move three times shower didn t drain properly cleanliness evidence of previous occupant left on floor 
 the staff are welcoming and happy english needs a tad refining 
 room a little warm we didn t manage to figure out the aircon but we opened the windows anyway 
 the room was a bit small it was really clean and all but a bit old
 unfortunately there was roadworks just outside our window so we were woken up rather early saturday morning by construction machines but once we shut the window we couldn t hear them room was also on the small side it was more cosy as opposed to spacious and luxury 
 the grand royale had an issue with the water boiler so we were moved to the shaftesbury hyde park just down the road we were upgraded and had breakfast included because of the inconvenience the staff at the shp were very helpful 
 bathroom extremely small bedroom was small wall where case stand was very scruffy and marked beautiful foyer but dusty was told i would be contacted by manager but wasn t 
 room was very very small and dark with only a tiny window to a dark backyard 
 the bed was not comfortable and the shower was near useless as it had no power 
 the single room was a bit small but comfy i stayed on the th floor but the elevator only went to the th 
 very small room noisy from above because of very creaky floorboards difficult drop off but mainly because of roadworks nearby parking costs reasonable for london no restaurant in hotel for dinner 
 we arrived to london at   am and we were supposed to have our room at  oo m therooms were not ready and they gave us something else 
 the furniture in the room was a little worn the desk chair was leather but with a lot of slits and missing leather from it it just felt a little tatty i would also recommend extending the shower door protector screen out a bit further as using the shower to wash hair meant the bathroom got soaked no ironing board in the room though 
 nothing bad it was as described and can t fault our stay
 room  was like a broom cupboard with a staircase above it from am no sleep due to the noise but we were moved after an early trip to reception thank you 
 we had to request a bedroom with a bathtub because most come with tiny little showers and the fridge wasn t very cold but these were both minor things 
 room was on the small side but we didn t seem to notice much as we were in and out a lot and the rest of the hotel made up for it 
 our room had this really bad odor in it the whole time you could barely move in there since the room is basicly to crowded with stuff but otherwise a good hotel 
 club rooms are not as big as seen in pictures since we were out the whole day for sight seeing it didn t made much of an issue but it hard to fit in  big size bags 
 we found our bedroom a club room with complimentary wine water fruit a little on the small side the bathroom was a bit cramped too however they were both clean so we shouldn t grumble 
 was charged twice for room refund takes   days parking cost  and that wasn t mentioned anywhere when booking room was tiny didn t look like anything in the pictures 
 there was no iron and ironing board in the room the coasters were cheap and flimsy the room we was first given had a steep stair case on entry which wasnt appealing 
 unpleasant drain smell from shower which pervaded room so had to keep window open 
 very small room difficult to move around hotel not very meticulously cleaned there were stains on the bathroom floor from the previous guests spider web on the ceiling corner very expensive for what it offers 
 was unable to connect my laptop to the wifi but it was working because i was able to connect my phone to it also the veiw but thats understandable 
 got there room didn t have not heating or hot water didn t have another room so put us in their sister hotel  mins away which isn t as good but still charged me same price not happy at all
 the facade of the hotel was being repaired i understand that it had to be done but i would have liked to have seen it i must return 
 could not get access to wifi room was small for price for the value breakfast should have been included bathroom looked basic i have stayed in travel lodges that have better bedroom facilities
 basement view after being upgraded apparently room was a little small or compact as they advertise them 
 there was building work being carried out and scaffolding
 rooms a little on the small side bathroom even more so in fact it was so small you had to go outside to change your mind 
 be careful about road construction around as it may impact your travel time by taxi 
 it definitely needs renovation room sizes were really small didnt seem worth the money or star rating we were disappointed
 we were told after our stay that our breakfast could ve been free if we d book directly through the hotel website we paid about  euros a morning for breakfast for  mornings 
 do not stay in room  tucked away in a dingy basement with no view it was plagued by a the frequent rumbling of underground trains from   am and b a random outside light switching itself on and off at regular intervals
 the rooms while clean are small
 the most small uncomfortable bed we have ever experienced for a double room along with the small room and a bathroom that was that small my head hit the ceiling in the showers and you had to climb down the side of the toilet to close the bathroom door to get to the sink and have privacy 
 lot of building works and bteakfasr quite expensive at   for a  year old
 the room was tiny looked over the back of the hotel it was really noisy early in the morning because of the bin men the bed was very small too soft 
 bedroom far too small and difficult to move around bed shower screen too small which meant we had to use towels to wipe toilet seat and floor dry
 we had a up grade to bigger room was wandering how big our other room was as up grade wasn t big at all also the decor needed up dating and repainting of doors especial bathroom which need a bit of gloss on it so it could be wiped in  also we reserved room with one debit card and wanted to pay with another but  days before we arrived they took money out of account which made me over drawn and then when we checked in they wanted payment for room so we payed with another card and was told it would take  days to process my refund on to original card this actually take longer than a cheque clearing so they had two amounts of money for one night stay not happy about this 
 the hotel wants to position itself somehow in the upscale but it s not up to that and fails ending up being awkwardly in the average where in facts its real positioning is 
 the view was terrible an alley with skips and rubbish it was covered by broken blinds taped to the window fire alarm at  am no one came to tell us it was false alarm or to apologise for the inconvenience staff just took payment don t do anything else like ask how was stay etc 
 tiny room small bed dirty toilet upon arrival dirty walls from scraches small menu for in room dining no slippers and bathrobes in the room they brought them after my call old room needs renovation 
 the room was very small for two persons the bed very small the bathroom is not existing 
 the room was supposed to be a double superior but not big enough for one too small not easy to negotiate with stairs to the toilet the bathroom too small had negotiate round the basin to gain access to shower too small very uncomfortable 
 could be more selection on the food menu 
 the hotel was undergoing a refurbishment and therefor there were areas closed and sealed off there was demolition signs and danger signs all over there was scaffolding up all over the front of the hotel the room wasn t clean the bed was stained and ripped the carpets were stained and there was damp on the walls a very disappointing stay
 basement corridors could do with repainting floors in reception need redoing 
 nice bar but the barman wasn t very friendly 
 some of the towels and sheets were not changed due to my stay there were few marks on bedding so wasn t replaced 
 i thought the dullness in the reception area gave a poor first impression lovely building so lets see it
 on arrival at   at night no room was available despite having rung and confirmed the previous day and we were sent to a tiny room in an inferior hotel this is the second time this has happened me with this hotel group this is totally unacceptable particularly with a short break when time is valuable 
 y
 due to restoration of the building the restaurant was not open although there is no shortage of restaurants and bars near by 
 bed a bit too hard and pillows a bit too big but that is just our preference
 rooms facing the back were a bit noisy probably because of the external units of the air conditioning but it was manageable rooms are rather small but this is common for london 
 rooms small and our children were placed in a room round the corridor which was away from our room we had asked for rooms close by breakfast waited  minutes before having to ask for coffee and tea crowded breakfast room and guest who had pre paid for breakfast were turned away
 room was very small didn t look like the photos and there was construction going on during our stay which we weren t aware of 
 quite cool in the reception area needs heating or an open fire to compliment the building no hot water for a shower on the evening or the following morning staff were very very good and issue with the above was resolved but put a dampener on the trip 
 rooms are tiny i think you should be v clear on that charging for a bottle of water on our second and third night is not good as it cost us one thousand euro to stay there the least i would expect is fresh water every day 
 the rooms were very small advertised as a superior double room but it s more like an average bedroom and for the amount paid you would definitely expect a little more the room was so cramped and i felt as though the bed was too big for the room there wasn t enough space to pull the stool out from the vanity mirror draws as the bed was in the way and there was only one side upon could access the bed from honestly i was very disappointed with this hotel and probably won t be returning to london for a short stay again and if the other hotels are like this i definitely won t it s awful that hotels can charge that much for a room and it be that small not sure if i may have looked wrong however the photos on the website showed a  poster bed which when i purchased the superior double room i expected to get and if what i got was a superior double room i would like to see how big a suite is another point would be the view i wasn t expecting a lot from the view because obviously it s not up high it s you average house size however the view was very poor however it s understandable that they can t change this but again for the money you pay you would expect a little better one rude female member of staff at reception see first paragraph you don t get what you pay for at this hotel not sure if this is the case throughout london however it is here i am almost  sure that i booked the hotel room and i received free breakfast for both myself and my partner however we did not receive one and the female member of staff i previously mentioned was quite rude about it and told me that we had to pay  each if we wanted it also of your thinking of site seeing i wouldn t recommend this hotel as it s quite far from the main attractions like the london eye or houses of parliament and the thames but there is a tube station round the corner which was helpful 
 the photos are enhanced on the internet as in reality the hotel is very very dark inside and if i m honest a bit dreary from outside it looks really poor and needs a paint and clean of windows it needs sensitively being freshened up throughout the decor is not consistent so a bit hit and miss bedrooms modern but not comfy beds or pillows sadly perhaps we had the smaller type room and should have upgraded we had very little space in ours that a glass fell from the bedside table and smashed as you could not move freely i wouldnt stay again 
 unfortunately the hotel had boiler problems and we were move to another in their group the grand park paddington   devonshire place which was not where we wanted to be 
 the room was very very small so a couple with  medium suitcases is not very easy to move around in the room the breakfast is a basic typical hotel breakfast i would expect a little a bit more than that 
 room was a club double but a little small the issue with the room was that the hotel had no hot water on the morning of our departure so i endured a cold shower and my daughter did not have one 
 club rooms slightly small especially shower toilet smaller than expected
 nothing 
 one thing we found strange is that you had to reserve the time you will go to take the breakfast from the day before or you might not find a table and will have to wait 
 hotel is dated hallways are marred and marked with luggage collisions construction in progress on the entrance side of the building 
 bedrooms very small but ok also when renovations complete i would think the hotel will be even better 
 room was tiny designation of double superior suggests at least adequate size but it was easily the smallest we have ever stayed in little more than  inches either side of the bed and not being able to open the wardrobe door is ridiculous 
 had amended booking but they didn t have the amendment had to wait for reservations to confirm even though i had proof restaurant far too small had sittings for breakfast so had to book time but they still couldn t accommodate us at the time and there was no room to pass tables walls thin could hear all toilets flushing and showers running from above below and either side 
 the layout of the bedroom through the door and immediately down five steps to the bed not good if ur unsteady on your feet also the floor boards in our room and the one above squeaked quite badly 
 they were renovating at xmas time scaffolding out front and fireplaces not being used and lounges pushed together we had booked many months beforehand and were not advised of this should have been offered discount and given opportunity of going elsewhere also toilet hard to use as it was too close to basin and shower i was very disappointed
 i was transferred from the original hotel i booked they couldn t provide a twin bed and i asked for a room with windows instead i was given a basement room they complementary phone didn t work 
 dont go here if you like to spend time on your room go here if you sleep in the hotel and you re out the whole day 
 nothing in particular room a little on the cool side but not uncomfortably so some of the decorations a little on the tired side but this is an old traditional property would recommend and have no hesitation in staying again 
 the overall look of the hotel was a bit neglected the picture on the web did not reflect the image the staff tried to help but some feel short where as some went beyond say what you mean do as you say 
 ordered a taxi from reception and they they did not know where they were going abd had not hear of the ritz do not order uber cabs for guests 
 the reception staff mundane lethargic not welcoming they need customer service skills they are the only thing that i found wrong with this hotel with the exception of an asian male receptionist who smiled welcomed people 
 room is rather cosy but perfect for a short stay comfortable and reasonably priced
 what they call a double bed could even fit   year old adults in dent in middle of matress fire alarm went off both rooms we had were so cold and drafty the whole room was so small when going to the toilet you could hardly sit down the hotel it s self is lovely but the rooms are far to small and beds for what we paid i have never ever left a review but feel in this instance it is necessary 
 the room was not upto standard carpets stained and the walls room door would not lock radiator was not working and lose we only got told the radiator was not working till after we complained as well as the door told to put the chain on we raised our concerns health and safety as the radiator could come off to be told its acceptable thermostat not working set on one temperature hairs all over the bed that was not mine partners i asked to change rooms which they did at no extra cost the new room was alot better but still hairs on the bed so had to shake it off went out for a meal and heard a conversation with another guest with the house keeper saying they had no room service that day it did not give us a good impression of the hotel will not be going back to this hotel 
 i didn t like not knowing about scaffolding and non working fireplaces also the printer was out of ink the entire time we were there and impeded our printing tickets etc 
 the room was very small thi s made it difficult to walk around the bed without catching your leg on the bedroom furniture
 there was mould around the bath the bath wasn t clean there was someone else s hair all around it
 they are renovating also a good thing ofcourse but the staff did everything to please us 
 room size we were upgraded to club room which was one of the larger room sizes this room was still very small incl the bathroom exercise care when selecting room size 
 rooms are very tight especially the front door couldn t swing open bigger and was a step down from the corridor floor some more difficult to pull my luggage in 
 sink in bathroom too small and plug let the water out because it didn t fit properly bathroom could have been a bit bigger 
 no need to change towels daily but no way of saying please don t having fair trade branded tea coffee sugar in room would be a great plus for me 
 it was quite a small room clean and quiet but with not a lot of space overnight it was very cold we asked for and received an extra blanket and a heater on the second night but shouldn t have needed to ask for it 
 the london weather 
 the room was tiny it was so disappointing considering i booked a superior room as soon as you opened the door there was  steps leading up to the room there is approx a foot and a half distance between the edge end of the bed and the steps lots of renovations going on the front and inside the hotel 
 room was small but manageable we weren t visiting to spend time in a hotel room so it wasn t much of a drawback 
 the room we were in was small compared to other hotels we have stayed in also mentioned to reception as i left fingerprint marks were on the bathroom door and the door jamb maybe needed wiping down as part of the room cleaning process 
 the hotel rooms are quite small they were clean but in need of decoration the entrance foyer and dining rooms are tired and somewhat dated and the breakfast while okay is expensive if not included in your rate we didn t like the fact that upon arrival we were told we couldn t have the rooms we booked and they were on  different floors we booked these rooms over  months in advance we were given a complimentary breakfast in compensation but our stay was spoiled by not having the rooms we requested meaning my daughters had to share a double bed i would not rate this hotel as a  star it s a  in my opinion 
 felt very deceived by this hotel booked a room at the grand royal to be contacted to be told we would have to move hotel we were being moved away from the original location that we booked the hotel did provide a taxi to take us to the new hotel but the room in this hotel grand paddington court was a lot smaller and very cramped i would not of paid the price we did for the room if i had seen it before hand i feel this hotel is intentionally deceiving customers by allowing them to book the grand royal knowing that they will be moved on arrival would not recommend at all bathroom was ridiculously small and the room was not suitable for a family of  would never use this chain of hotels again
 bed was too small and the property was loud this was the only property i used a debit card in and on return to the us someone in the uk area cloned my card and used it to withdraw cash not recommended 
 view from room was of a wall wasn t made aware of construction of building and change of room before arrival which was disappointing
 lady rang asked if we wanted room cleaned we said yes but she never cleaned that s ok we asked at reception they said she must have picked me up wrong but yes means yes at the end of the day so we said just leave clean towels for morning but they didn t arrive unhappy about that 
 the room was tiny really small it barely fitted the bed in it really the window was not very secure or soundproof heatproof was old and breezy but my main gripe is that on arriving i was told i have to provide a credit card i didn t have the same card on me as i booked with so embarrassingly had to use my partners however despite the hotel being paid for in full they then charged my partners card without telling us for the full amount when i got home i noticed that i had been charged twice and i phoned them up which took over an hour of being kept waiting on hold to be then told that yes there is a mistake and it will take  days for the money to be returned to my account it would have been a nice stay but it was marred by these issues 
 very basic and ungenerous place without feeling having a drink in the bar and reading newspaper staff member dimmed lighting at   pm really rude towels grey instead of white bedding low quality you just feel like a package being pushed through a system on the cheap 
 shower involved high step up and over which was cumbersome for this older traveler 
 the room was absolutely tiny the smallest i ve ever stayed in my boyfriend is   and they put us in a room in under the eaves the night staff and staff who checked us out seemed so disinterested mtv was playing in the lobby which did not suit the decor or  star status we were also not informed of the renovation works being done the whole facade is covered in scaffolding and the fireplaces in the foyer are covered over with big sheets of a plastic and one is completely blocked off with sofas the building work outside woke us up at about  am this may have been acceptable if we had been warned prior to our stay or even when we checked in but it was not mentioned at all and this is really good enough our stay was not that of a four star hotel 
 scaffolding outside the building due to renovations and fires in reception were not lit 
 we weren t advised of the renovations taking place at the time of booking the facade was covered by scaffolding and sheets which made the reception and rooms dark the rooms are very small and claustrophobic the rooms we were upgraded to on nd floor had flimsy paper blinds that failed to open and those that did provided an unpleasant view of the backyard of neighbouring flats and bins however the rooms we moved to in the basement  and  were much more spacious 
 when we arrive the hotel we  rooms for  nights were asked to move to stay at another hotel because water warmer in our bathrooms don t work without prior notice and without any other option even the booking has been done about   months in advance we were very disappointed it was unprofessional and unacceptable even the new hotel was not bad but we were inconvenience with its location far from tube station 
 no tea or coffee replaced on our second day but that was soon rectified by the front of house staff
 we were first shown room  which was so small it should only be listed as a single certainly not as a double but we asked to be moved and they showed us a couple of rooms and one was much better so i cannot fault the service the bathrooms are fabulous best i have ever seen however the pictures on the web site give a very different impression of what the hotel is actually like very clever photography gives a very false idea of the size of the main areas the bar and lounge areas are tiny and not big enough to accommodate the amount of people that could potentially be staying there we came back in at around   pm and there was only one space left for us to sit at in the bar area others came in later and had to stand unfortunately for us the hotel is being refurbished at the moment so wasn t looking at its best with scaffolding covering the whole building and many features inside were covered up with settees and flower stands removed which is a shame as it is a beautiful building all in all a nice stay but not a great one 
 although the breakfast was lovely due to the size we were asked to state a time for which we wanted to take it this was a little difficult but it didn t affect our stay we would use the hotel again 
 i had the best experience ever thank you 
 small rooms confusion at my check in could not arrange me a room due to maintenance problems offered me to stay at a hotel nearby after  mins they manage to sort me a room at their hotel 
 the only issue was that the duvet was too light and too small for a double bed so we had to keep the heating quite high to compensate the bathroom was small but had a bath the room was clean when we checked in but the quality of housekeeping in the subsequent days was not the best they never cleaned the spot of toothpaste that fell on the sink counter the check in process was a pain we arrived at   so  minutes early than the check in time so the room was not ready that was ok and we decided to wait in the hall no one ever came to tell us the room was ready and after  minutes i had to enquire and the person at the check in desk did not know and had to go and ask someone else when we finally got the key  minutes later we had to wait another  minutes to get our luggage which they insisted to put away instead of leaving it with us in the hall overall the experience was ok and the price quality good for london 
 small room very unkept in the decorating side pealing paint and at the back of the hotel so very noisy
 the fact that the room we had booked was out of service and we were sent to a smaller grand royale hotel 
 room very old wallpaper coming off wall and covered in marks carpet coming away from wall and where joined together bed very hard and uncomfortable bathroom very small but has been updated terrible smell coming into room through air con vent we phoned reception who said they knew about it and were trying to fix it but we never heard anything disappointing this hotel is not for us 
 wouldn t stay here again after all the trouble we had got to the grande royal hotel about half  at night in which they said to us oh did u not get a phone call because aparently half of the rooms didn t have hot water in which they offered us a drink and taxi to a sister hotel on arrival here the hotel was no where near as nice and we felt we had been fobbed off a little bit totallly dissapointed we went to our room which was nice and comfortable the only problem was after the first night we wanted room service in bed for our second morning and to watch tv turns out this hotel couldn t even provide us with the basics as the wifi had gone off all the phones had been cut off and the tvs were shut down with no signal on the screen totally dissapointed i made sure staff where aware on our last morning i took it upon myself when i got to the sister hotel to trip advisor the grand royal as my partner had booked it as a surprise for part of my christmas present on reviewing these it seamed the hotel since september had been selling the same scam story about hot water issues and plumbing avoid 
 booked in october for a better deal and found that on the night of staying in january it was around  cheaper staff unhelpful when informed basically couldnt care less rooms were far too small as was the bathroom which had rusty nuts on light fittings and hairs on cups and in bathroom back of bathroom door was very dirty very disappointed so went elsewhere for breakfast definitely won t be staying again in this very tired hotel 
 see above window looking out on the rough side 
 there was no fridge within the room we stayed in and the room was quite small also we found the breakfast room way to small we felt we were sitting on top of each other whilst eating our breakfast temperature was far too hot 
 building work under way but was not informed when we booked for food only breakfast and snacks no lunch or dinner in the restaurant floor boards in room all loose and very noisey and shower screen to small so all water went on the floor 
 initially we stayed in room  we couldn t sleep all night due to the extremely loud noise from the pipes it seems that there is a problem with certain rooms this noise however to credit the hotel when i complained the next morning we were moved to another room which was perfect 
 the room was tiny and not enough storage for  suitcases and clothes in wardrobe more like a single room with a bed for a double room reception was always busy so always a que building works affected aesthetic and breakfast room use yet but price still the same snacks limited etc in bar and served in packets not expected for star rating 
 the room was not cleaned properly the tables were soiled and food on the floor after the room was cleaned not very thorough 
 the attitude of the staff during the check in the assumption that i wanted two single beds even though i booked a double room how the attitude of the staff changed when they found out we were a gay couple so called technical problem with the room i wouldn t recommend staying here 
 even though im a genius and booking com said no deposit would be taken and no prepayment was required the hotel still took out a deposit from my credit card prior to arriving 
 room not very big limited space between bed and wall small wardrobe front of the building covered because of repair
 probably the smallest double i have ever stayed in if this was a superior double i would hate to see a standard room i couldn t use the safe as there wasn t enough room to open it 
 we arrived at   and our room was still not ready so we waited in the bar for  minutes until our room was ready which delayed what we were doing that day by over an hour 
 room was super small very very loud you could hear everything outside the hotel and inside very uncomfortable bed 
 when we arrived they told as that they didn t have any room available and they asked as if we wanted to stay in another hotel they had we said no we had booked this room  months ago at the end they found a room available in the basement with no window etc we didn t accept and then by miracle they found one available on the th floor the rooms are very small
 rooms were too warm at times the bedding only included a duvet and no top sheet shower was extremely small with very low water pressure 
 the first room the gave which it was on the th floor its was like a grave and not even a room it was really shocking then they moved me to the basement which it was a bit better room it was no  but the st room i didn t recall what number was it 
 the bathroom was tiny 
 the room was so small for  people we had to take turns putting our suitcase on the bed to get things out and hanging our coats on the one chair made it so tight getting to and from the bathroom our room had a horrible smell of damp which was very unappealing unable to get any fresh air in the room so it was very uncomfortable 
 i don t see how any improvements could be made to the quality of the room cleaning services and position of the hotel i would definitely return 
 really straggled with the pushchair as there s no disabled access ramp at the entrance and our room was at the ground floor so we had to lift it again 
 surly unhelpful staff and no room available reception staff economical with the truth regarding reason for unavailability frankly told lies most unhelpful would never go near the place again
 the hotel was clean our room was small for a club room and it was on the lower ground so no view had i been informed about the scaffolding and work being done in the main dining room i would of looked for an alternative property for our stay this was disappointing as it was a special evening i booked for my wife as a surprise 
 property is not quite a  since it needs some renovation no mini bar in the room 
 rooms are rather small still one has everything he she needs 
 my room was tiny had to shuffle sideways around the bed the bath bathroom were tiny felt i d paid to stay in a cupboard we will never go back there 
 no water at all when needed even to flush loo due boilerwork no offer of compensation or change of accommodation found nibbled biscuit on floor delux double very basic with view of scaffolding no response from hotel despite  emails to manager very disappointing experience 
 some rooms are tiny no room for big luggage or movement or without a window towels could have been bigger and there are no robes or sleepers no ventilation in the bathroom and the waters were running out from the bath 
 the room was tiny we had an upgrade to a club room at check in as it was bigger which was very nice of them the superior double room must have been like a cupboard if this was the case feel like  odd was a bit steep for a small room shame about the scaffolding on the outside but that couldn t be helped 
 the double room is rather tight and there is no space for large luggage or movement in the room rather disappointed no robes or slipper or shower cap complimentary bottled water is given on st day but not on subsequent days as compared to other hotels that i have stayed 
 the room aren t that great the pipes makes a lot of noise during the night which didn t make us sleep really well
 the room was very cold the radiator did not work the tvs channels didn t work the front door did not lock a lot of the switches in the room didn t work i asked for an extra blanket calling room service twice as they forgot and they brought it an hour later 
 my boyfriend and i wanted to spend a special christmas in london and decided to splurge on what was advertised in pictures a lavish london hotel the room we received was nothing like the pictures advertised it was very small and very plain the decor was very outdated and looked like it was from the  s or something the breakfast was  pounds per person which is ridiculous the staff messed up my room payment which made the check in a nightmare the bar staff did not know how to properly make drinks overall i was thoroughly disappointed with the hotel our room looked straight out of a motel  and was so small we could barely move around not exaggerating we could barely move this was not a supposedly a  star grand royale hotel i will never go back here and do not recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a lush place to stay in london for the amount we paid we expected a lot more its not as advertised 
 our room was in the attic i think it was very small indeed however we didn t explore other options and it was cheap so we don t take it personally room a little tired and should really be sold as a single 
 the superior double room was small there were no bedroom slippers n toothbrushes the cloak cabinet were tiny like a budget hotel there is no space for large luggages there is no fridge as compared to the twin which has a fridge complimentary bottled water given during check in but not for subsequent days of stay 
 the place was nothing like the picture on the website we requested a crib for our baby and they gave us a baby playard and a blanket after they put it together we didn t fit the room was underground no view the heat didn t work and the bed uncomfortable i didn t even bother complaining since it was only one night but i regret not spending  more ando going to a better place 
 the room is extremely small and the double bed barely fit ultra small wardrobe combined with compact space made living from large suitcases quite uncomfortable 
 tiny rooms old and smelly having work done inside and on the front which wasn t aware of when booked so appearance wasn t great didn t like the stay 
 restaurant to serve meals rather than just sandwiches ice creams were advertised as ben and jerrys but were a different less well known make 
 upon arrival we couldn t see hotel only scaffolding very disappointing nobody told us about renovations reception staff very helpful but overall hotel is very tired rooms not at all like pictures paint flaking duvet cover didn t fit bed net curtains dirty i would say a rating of   at most such a shame as staff were so nice 
 i didn t feel safe within the hotel and unfortunately had problems on the night of my boyfriends birthday as a man who wasn t staying at the hotel was very drunk we he to get staff to come redo the bed sheets which was really embarrassing finding pubic hair on our sheets the hotel did do us a upgrade as we was scared the man that was very drunk threatened us the police was called sadly it did ruined our night and the upgraded room wasn t special enough to save our trip personally i wouldn t recommend the hotel i had saved to take my boyfriend to london 
 nothing negative to say
 we didn t get a room on our first night apparently there was a problem with the boiler so we had to go to a sister hotel called the metropolitan hotel this was very inconveniant given that we lost a lot of time getting there and returning the next day in addition we didn t even know where they would bring us to even though we had to pay for the whole duration of our stay upon arrival at the grand royale the sister hotel did not meet our expectations either when we returned to the grand royale the following day we had to wait again in order to get our room all in all we lost a lot of time waiting around which was quite annoying given that we only stayed in london for two nights 
 the room was very small bed was small and bathroom was to small to get in couldn t move in there also hairdryer wouldn t come out of drawer so couldn t dry hair well not good value for money false advertising expensive for what you get 
 the staff where so unhelpful telly broken complimentary drinks half drunk staff couldn t have cared less very disappointed and i m not normally one to complain 
 room was fairly cramped the shower screen was far too small water kept going all over the floor and the water wasn t actually on for the first few hours we were there
 couldn t get a sit down breakfast in the resteraunt in the morning we had to perch on the small double in our room single glazing and noise from the street made for an uncomfortable night internet was intermittent the mobile phone inoperable 
 room was small and they gave me an upgrade 
 nothing
 there are two truths to this property s description yes it s in london yes it s on hyde park this is where it ends the grand royale is no hotel it is a hostel whether it s the mouse hole rooms lonely soaring lobby or the other fooled tourists making life miserable for the teenage staff you will regret staying here the room wasn t clean the double bed accommodates two half people and the toilet shower and sink are located together in a phone booth spend a few quid and upgrade your stay somewhere else 
 they state superior double room but not kidding it s a box size the st room had no space on one side of bed a day was ft space between foot of bed and wall we requested change they did but then nd room smelt of damp so rd time lucky 
 would have been nice to have a ramp for our buggy and we had to leave our buggy at reception as it would not fit but that was ok 
 sold as a family hotel when clearly it is not steps to hotel no access for disabled or pram users dining g area only had  high chair which we had to wait for
 not being informed of scaffolding outside and fireplaces blocked up with polythene there was even a delivery of toilet rolls heaped outside poor impression really 
 the bed was too small we are used to kingsize and concequently we don t sleep too well 
 lifts rated as for  persons which could only accommodate  people with luggage before the overloaded alarm sounded but as the hotel was undergoing a major facelift this may have been a factor 
 they had our rooms mixed up and gave our key to someone else after we d checked in another couple walked in when we were having a nap not great room are tiny however i appreciate that goes with the territory in london 
 quite expensive from last time we stayed brother in laws room was cheaper that our by   and we had same room and staff could not tell us why
 room is a bit small you could hear people walking on the floor from the top room all the time staff however claimed that they would look into the matter 
 hotel changed from the one booked meant a much longer walk to the nearest tube station i cannot accept that it was not known earlier that work was underway at the booked site 
 expensive breakfast small room and small bathroom our room was on the ground floor but we had to climb some stairs with our luggage and no elevator
 the filthy sheer curtains in my room and the tiny night stands my view was pretty bad too also there was scaffolding on the building which couldn t be helped but destroyed the atmosphere 
 the bathroom was quite small 
 the smallest room and bed i have ever stayed in i tried to request a change but the internet was down and they d get back to me which never happened 
 upgraded to a deluxe double from superior or were we as it was extremely small unable to upgrade further which was disappointing bathroom was a tiny en suite which was a joke stairs inside room to the bed room was unbearably hot air conditioning didnt work staff arguing in the bar fire alarm set off staff unsure what to do would not recommend this hotel 
 bar area was musty smelling and the sauvignon blanc chilean no choice was suitable for your fish and chips rammed into the tiny breakfast restaurant admittedly due to current hotel restorations but just not great even after having to book a time to make sure it wasn t to busy 
 for the price the room was a little small but it was only to sleep in so it didn t really matter 
 being woken by housekeeping staff talking for ages and very loudly right outside our door even though do not disturb was on display
 club bar coffee good but such a strange room to call a bar its an internal room with no outside light 
 not told restaurant was being renovated or we had to book a table for breakfast so no room for us in the morning room very small and draughty no nice lobby lounge as on website as restaurant now there got charged for breakfast even though couldnt get in 
 staff failed to warn about building work and we were disturbed by banging above the fruit platter contained a mouldy plum and unripe pear 
 rooms very tiny and lower ground a bit like a rabbit warren 
 the room is too smaller than which we see on the website especially in the bathroom i cannot even turn around 
 work was being carried out which we weren t aware of the rooms were tiny very little space to get around the bed and the beds were small our feet hung over the edge despite having booked a deluxe room there was no decent public space to relax in either the theatre was freezing and the lobby was unappealing despite the lovely photos the cleanliness of the room was poor very dusty lots of marks on the walls and floor and the sheets had not been changed since the last guests the staff did try their best including moving rooms as the heater was making a noise in the first room but the move itself was very shambolic they did apologise and gave us complementary chocolates and wine but we shall not stay here again when there are lots of other lovely hotels in the same area for the same price 
 bar could have stayed open a little later
 the room was of poor quality asked to be moved the did to a room that was just as poor the area where the put me up bed was damp the wallpaper stained had not been cleaned throuher it was a mess waiting for the manager to contact me with no effect had to pay for breakfast when i booked with you breakfast was included i can go on an on
 the first room we were giving was a basement room which was tiny and freezing as the window wasn t properly sealed which in december isn t great they did however move us to a slightly larger room which was nice and warm i thought overall it was very expensive for what it was 
 the value for place is absolutely ridiculous the price we paid was totally high compare to the standard received i would give this hotel stars minus just for the location the hotel charged mi  pounds before my arrival without saying what it is for i have of course paid fully for my stay at the time of check in so in my opinion this is overusing my credit card details
 bedroom was the smallest i ve ever stayed in and apparently we were given a free upgrade to a club room god knows what the standard room size is like they accidentally booked someone else into our room and blocked our key card but apologized and gave us a free bottle of wine 
 staff attempted to relocate due to maintenance issue but weren t prepared to pay for taxis staff were unhelpful waited  minutes for bags at departure and when asked they hadn t even given the ticket to the attendant scaffolding outside poor
 we didn t appreciate the hotel trying a bait and switch on us they tried to get us to move to their sister hotel using the same spurious maintenance excuse they ve been using all year it seems after making a loud fuss at reception a room was miraculously available for us after all 
 grand royale is extremely tired and run down for a hotel charging these rates decor was extremely shabby and facilities were of a poor standard we had to ask to switch rooms as the tv didn t even work and we were told it couldn t be fixed walls were marked in corridor and our room and stains on the divan bed this hotel is in need of either a huge refurb or needs to drastically drop its rates 
 it was the worst experience i reached there  am as scheduled but the reception staff informed us that there is no room available due to boiler problem they have waited till we reached the hotel to inform us that there is no room they never contacted us or phoned to say anything moreover they have send us with a taxi to a horrible hotel with nasty smell and noisy ac which we couldn t use to heat the room so it ended up with a tiny electric heater beside the bed 
 we booked a superior double expecting something double and superior our room  was just a bit bigger than a large cupboard my wife and i had to squeeze against the wall for one another to pass we are not heavy weights we were not informed that the hotel is under refurbishment at the time of booking therefore not expecting the facilities to be severely limited and certainly not expecting the breakfast to be served in the downstairs lounge where tables are closer than macdonalds restaurant there were many people complaining and the atmosphere for staff was not good and despite this they were cheerful and trying to please guests 
 my reservation was double bed deluxe however room given maximum i could say single superior and when i complain to the receptions they says hotel are full and no compensation was offered 
 room small and smelt like drains stained bedding yuck room  right by a staff door that banged every few mins from dawn def not worth then money 
 i had a sleepless night at this hotel the room  must have the air conditioning system outside it there was a hum of noise from this system all night the equivalent of an idling car which was impossible to sleep through i won t be staying again 
 the front of the property was covered in scaffolding we were not made aware of this we were in the basement although nice rooms no view or phone signal 
 renovation works in parts of the hotel were perhaps an eyesore but this didn t stop us enjoying our stay 
 the room was small but the character of the hotel made up for it in a large modern hotel you could wake up anywhere in the world and it would look the same not here you are in london 
 everything but the most shocking was the room i paid  for a room that didn t had nothing to do with what showed in the pic disappointed 
 the building was a under construction arrived to find hotel covered in scaffolding staff then lied and said it weren t there s even though it was blatantly surrounding their building 
 single rooms too many stairs items towel holders safes mirrors when foggy too high   people wardrobe unstable no headboard   loo roll need sliding door to ensuite not enough space dangerous at night
 breakfast not being included within the fee shown st the time of booking 
 rooms were a little small and the bathroom could have done with a bit of a clean 
 the room was tiny extremely small and not well laid out at all there was no fridge for us to keep anything in and we only had water on the first night not worth  for  nights at all and definitely not  
 i ordered a bottle of prosecco for my arrival we were delayed a check in by  minutes whilst this was organised then when i got to my room there was no bottle i had to call reception and wait  more minutes the pictures online make the rooms look much bigger than they are to the point of being unbelievable 
 the room was a little cold responsive heating but had to get out of bed to switch on room  window blinds did not move so could not see outside felt like in room without a window altho view was not good from the room nets or voile would have been better with working blind 
 the room was a little to small but we manged fine
 nothing to comment that s right nothing at all very friendly staff beautiful hotel very accommodating will definitely stay again 
 the fact we got separated as a family we booked  double rooms and a triple room so we could all be together but rooms were split across  levels and a mother and  kids meant for the family room had to be split up due to maintenance in the family room that nobody notified us about so caused some upset for the kids could of been a bit more efficient as waited at least an hour of our time to sort this out overall
 i didn t like being asked to move hotels as they had a boiler problem i was also disappointed that the large lounge area with open fire which i had enjoyed on a previous stay was closed off and we couldn t use it 
 i read the reviews about how small the rooms are but did not believe how tiny it is until i saw it you literally cannot have  people walking around at the same time the staff are not fully informed about london and transport which was unhelpful for me as a tourist 
 the bedroom and ensuite were very small but well modernised renovation work was progressing so the main dining room was out of action making the smaller breakfast room very crowded 
 my room was cancelled they offered me to move to another hotel i didn t agree so one night we spent in a small room in basemen the next day we moved on the first floor in a standard room 
 as i booked online well in advance the cost of the room was held on my debit card i paid by credit card but am still waiting for the amount stopped on my debit card to be unblocked iwas told it would be credit straight away dont think this should happen as i am not rich and need every penny so i am without funds at this time because of this
 there were building works on the outside of the building which we were not told about and found this very disappointing however having said that they did not affect our stay at all 
 room service was only sandwiches although plenty of places to eat nearby
 bathroom was tiny shower was the size of a small phone booth you could barely turn around the room was so small there wasn t room for a chair for the small desk 
 unlike every other hotel i have ever had to book for colleagues this one refused to take payment in advance over the phone which put me in an awful position they should say they don t take payment other than face to face on the website awful customer service i was waiting on the phone for  minutes and then instead of even trying to help they said just come in 
 the building is under construction the rooms are small old a bit dirty very than the pictures and various prices in different websites
 lock on bedroom door was broken exterior bedroom doors were filthy and everywhere looked like it was in need of a good clean redecoration and some tlc at checkin we were told we d been upgraded to a family suite the room was depressing and when we asked reception tif we could see the room we d booked we were advised that there weren t any available the upgrade was clearly a con we d have been much more understanding if we d been told the truth from the outset the family suite was a major disappointment dingy with dirty marked walls and carpet that looked grubby and threadbare around the edges hotel was run down inside and not at all like the internet photos the bar was unfriendly and uninviting as was the furniture it lacked atmosphere and the carpet was filthy especially around the windows the beds were comfortable but not sure why we had two single beds when we d requested a double when we mentioned the door lock to reception to be fair they removed my   beer tab from the bill my wife did not drink her unchilled glass of white wine and the rather surly barman reluctantly didn t charge for it which was appreciated no restaurant or room service we were very disappointed as nothing about this hotel felt or looked  staff were pleasant enough 
 the first room i was given was  which is right at the top of the building in what feels like the attic and the water heater in was bubbling all night and i could not sleep 
 it wasn t the hotel i oringinally booked we were moved to this hotel then i find out there wasn t enough beds so they wanted to move me a third time again but i refused they had a pullout bed which was only big enough for a child wasn t happy especially being there  nite stay and had excursions booked in 
 at arrival i was assigned to a room that looked more as a closet or pantry than a guest room it had a step right at the entrace and it was so small that two persons were not able to stand around the room at the same time then we asked for a room change then we were transferred to a larger room not big with a bed barely capable to fit a couple of a standard size the lobby is depressing it seems to be from the queen victoria era 
 we got upgraded to a club room lord knows what standard is like room  almost behind a cupboard door next to a fire exit it looked like room very small with the tiniest of windows which was frosted and when opened looked out onto a passageway full of air conditioning vents and old cars bed has broken springs so every time one of you moves the other rides the wave bathroom clean and shower ok but really poor value bar closed at  and breakfast was a whopping  each we didn t have it 
 i had a superior room which was probably a single in a past life very small not great value for  per night bar service was very slow as the barman kept disappearing 
 the room was a little small but that is to be expected in inner london to compensate we were within  minute walk to hyde park 
 rooms small difficult to actually sit down at the desk air con didn t work properly 
 the bed was one of the most uncomfortable i have ever slept in and very small for a double good job only ft  the bathroom was very small the shower was adequate but you could not turn in it 
 overall appearance of the hotel requires a little attention love the original character shame its not used to a better advantage bedding very poor and room very small even in the club rooms decor bland and dated 
 the room size was small and the bathroom was extra small but we made it work out ok 
 the bed linen wasn t changed we were there for  nights also want that happy that on our little balcony we had a sex toy 
 the rooms themselves were far below average extremely small with almost no room to move 
 decor and condition of rooms dated and tired very small room but i guess it is london 
 arrived to find beautiful building in scaffolding queues at reception and some guests being moved to other hotels never did find out what the problem was but the chaos was not handled well by staff and there were sections taped off with no entry signs had requested to check in one hour early but room not ready ok so they had a problem won t hold that against them asked to see room anyway as it was a very special occasion and i had upgraded to a so called club room taken first to a tiny twin and was told the beds could be pushed together asked for a proper double room and was eventually shown one but it was still absolutely tiny frankly if i hadn t been on a time limit to get to the theatre i would have found somewhere else the bathroom as mentioned modern and clean was little more than a cupboard the room was very small and there was no natural light windows were covered in permanent papery blinds to disguise outside bin store area we were told that it was one of the best rooms in the hotel but i don t see how it could be or how you could get smaller just labelling the door club room is meaningless my basic beef is that i paid extra for what i considered was a very basic room didn t have breakfast there after checkout manager emailed me to ask for feedback and assuring me he was there to help in any way he could i gave him feedback and two weeks later he hasn t replied sadly would not stay again booked it as was such a beautiful old building but what a disappointing experience 
 bedroom was very small a foot between bed and wall window it was also very uncomfortable everything was small shower area towels etc on arrival they tried to get me to move to a sister hotel 
 rooms were very small and the noise from outside was clearly heard what sounded like fireworks at midnight a police car at am 
 a huge disappointment for me was the hotel is going through extensive restoration i booked this hotel after a great deal of research on the basis of staying in a historic building with british charm and character what i discovered when i arrived was the fact that the hotel s lovely exterior was covered in scaffolding the gorgeous public areas you see on their site were closed including the dining room this was not disclosed when i booked and i wouldn t have reserved if i had known in advance they requested full payment on my credit card when i checked in and i regret agreeing to that as i should have cancelled the booking and looked elsewhere so if you are expecting to experience what you see on their website you will be most disappointed 
 as an old building it s a bit of a maze walking around the hallways
 the staff in the kitchen lost it at one stage waiting for a time for coffee and taost
 avoid g floor i was in room  and got terribly disturbed by the smell of the food i guess it was from either the breakfast room or the kitchen not good for resting 
 small room couldn t open the window shower is small and when you take a shower it floods the entire bathroom no bed side lamp so either you re in extreme light or darkness bed is small there are cracks on the walls and they re falling apart oh yes and no coat hangers
 we couldn t buy the breakfast we had been told they are to busy to supply all guest with breakfast it is rediculouse the bed linen was stinked rooms are very tiny and toilet bathroom are so small you can t dry yourself after the shower no room for it the four stars on the website of this hotel is fake it is hardly three stars by uk standards i will give it two stars 
 our room did have a window but we were not able to open it no daylight and blin glass very small room and very small bed considering that  people should slep in there 
 the room was absolutely tiny never stayed in a room so small and to think it cost almost  euro is awful first night bed was so hard we woke up with pains moved room to a smaller didn t think it was possible to go smaller room we couldn t walk into the room together it was so small couldn t walk around the bed without hitting the radiator and could touch the bathroom sink from the bed awful size to call it a bedroom definitely would not return caravan would be bigger
 scaffolding outside the whole building i paid for a surprise visit for my father and was shocked to see the exterior without even being told booked a twin deluxe room wasn t even suitable for a deluxe single room bathroom couldn t move bath toilet washbasin all squashed into a tiny room when the door opened it hit the bed couldnt even sit at dressing table to dry hair had to go to reception to ask for more coffee and milk sachets really poor going to book breakfast but room was being refurbished although another area available the hotel had a bit of history but sadly my visit will remain history it was really poor
 see above
 bed was too soft
 price is bit high for the size of the room per say but considering its located in only  minutes from oxford street and its right next to hyde park its quite nice pricing they should have resupplied water on the second day as well no fridge available in the room no slippers provided breakfast had to be booked and paid separately and rather pricey for a regular hotel buffet and does not offer an omelet they do offer fried eggs breakfast was bit salty but that is just typical english style and it is rather subjective matter 
 tried to have a bath one of the evenings i m pregnant and would have loved a hot bath after a long day but no hot water pretty disappointing 
 the room while clean and updated was very small i know that is not unusual in london but we were disappointed at that price point it was difficult to get out of the bed on one side as it was almost to the wall and no room for luggage to be left out and open that s really our only complaint hotel has an interesting history and was fine for our needs 
 the stairs the poky room with more steps immediately inside to the sleeping area making entry with bags very difficult small bathroom and lack of ventilation and a rock hard bed 
 extremely small rooms look nothing like the picture if you take the lowest category you won t have any space left for your luggages some of the staff were rude other really nice no standards 
 big queues so took a long time to check in room was on the sub level so couldn t get a phone signal 
 rooms are tiny with little space to move or place luggage bathroom was the tiniest i have ever seen 
 hotel has a number of sister sites nearby they tried to get me to move to a cheaper hotel because there was an issue when i said i reserved the right to come back and cancel without penalty if i did not like the new one they remarkably found a room for me in the original hotel 
 the location was not  miles from the venue i was attending there was scaffolding covering the front entrance the road was shared with several hostel type buildings they let a colleague check into my room without id and no reference to her name on my booking good job she wasn t a stalker 
 some interesting characters at the adjacent hotels and apartments hanging outside in the evening perhaps that s our fault for being outdoors after dark 
 we stayed when renovation work going on so shrouded in scaffold shame because it s a wonderful building drawing room as in brochure being used as dining room so sitting area is in the entrance hall or bar 
 the twin room we shared was extremely small would have been suitable for single room there was no way the room temperature could be controlled in the evening when the central heating was turned on the staff provided a fan to cool the room until morning when the room air con was activated
 can t think of anything to complain about 
 the st room we booked was nothing like the picture despite ringing booking com and confirming that also upgrading the room through them also getting to the hotel we paid a extra  for a family room upgrade which was ok so on the whole the room costed us  for a family room which was absolutely ridiculous as we could ve stayed in mayfair for that price plus it was our anniversary weekend and wasn t pleasant at all will not be going back there again or booking with booking com and either 
 disabled access really needs improving 
 the building work outside our room was quite noisy which disrupted our mornings the rooms slightly too small
 i had booked online and was informed i could pay at the property the hotel debited my account on the friday prior to my stay on the sunday which i wasn t overly concerned with as i had no plans to cancel on checking in they asked for the balance of the room i explained that the money had already been debited from account and i was told that it was just to hold the room and i would need to pay again so in theory i have paid twice for the room i have been assured that the holding amount will be credited back to my account within  days but this not very good practice and would put me off booking an overnight break with this hotel again 
  stairs straighr down into the room from the door if you have stair issues be sure to mention this when you book 
 rooms are very old fashioned and small bathroom is small too with an old and not a particularly practical layout i e glass shower screen was too small and as a result the floor was covered in water after using the shower 
 we got stuck in the lift twice which was quite frightening the bed we had needed replacing as the springs had collapsed the power points lost power one morning therefore unable to use hairdryer or recharge devices i think it should noted on the website that scaffolding across the front of the building could raise concerns of noise and inconvenience
 the account of my colleague who reported that there was a rat in one of the rooms the lift didn t work properly there was building work going on everywhere the place was dusty 
 the rooms could have been bigger the first room i was offered was very small more like a storage room insulting and really disappointing
 fridge and air con didn t work we only realised as we were leaving so it s possibly fixed now no good coffee shops close
 the room is extremly small and i found insects in the room and the reception 
 room was way too hot and couldn t adjust temperature because window fused shut 
 rooms were really small which was fine for one person but i would find sharing a deluxe with another person really difficult there s no restaurant for dinner and after getting off a long haul flight it would have been nice to sit inside the hotel instead of wondering queensway 
 they claimed they had a boiler problem and hence could not honour the booking they said they will provide rooms at another hotel which was their sister concern also called grand royale and equally good but sent us off to shaftesbury hotel where we were asked to share one room for three persons for the first night the second night we were transferred to two rooms but they were so tiny we could not even open our suitcases plus there were awkward steps to get in and out of the room that hotel did not even have a restaurant except for breakfast after much complaining we were given a better room but nowhere near the rooms shown for the grand royale it appears that the grand royale london hyde park is used to attract bookings on booking sites and then people are sent off to a much lower standard hotel in my opinion they are confidence tricksters one guest had evened called the police when we were there in the lobby for the same reason the hotel was not shut as other guests were given and stayed in rooms since i was with family and had a lot of luggage we had to lump it as it was already night they killed the joy and ruined our holiday 
 the hotel was having building work which was not advertised there wasn t noise but it wasn t as beautiful as expected due to the works the rooms were also very small
 we were given a tiny room where we could hardly move and tiny bed for two pearls we asked to be changed and we were given one slightly bigger but next to the breakfast room very noisy even at am besides the door of the bathrooom was sticky and i told them but never cleaned it the bathroom was like a box where one could hardly move inside and the shower as well they wouldn t make reservations for the opera and if you call a taxi there they send you cars with their own prices which were a rip off 
 room very small hotel overcharged significantly on sterling exchange rate and booking site kept giving diffetent excuses but never solved it 
 the rooms are smaler then photos but is a national trust old building so it s worth it
 my requirements were ignored leaving my travel companion staying in the room i booked but given the light respiratory health issues allergies the bathroom smelling of cigarettes and the room being cramped left me with the an option not to stay at this hotel did not want to go through the frustrating conversations at reception but would not stay again definitely not value for money paid given the room on a ground floor where you can barely move around in and a smell of cigarettes in the bathroom 
 staff disorganised trainee on front desk who was unsupported and unable to check us in rooms very small and some basement level smelt of stale cigarette smoke 
 pricey for what you get and bathroom could get cramped at times couldn t have a shower without flooding the room
 the door into the room would not open fully because of the wardrobe the bedrooms were tiny one side of the bed was only cm away from the wall and a radiator was stuck out from that leaving cm up the side of the bed we had asked for larger rooms and they tried to charge us extra for this i refused to pay any extra as i couldn t beleive there were any smaller rooms 
 bed was very uncomfortable fridge didnt get cold wasn t really worth the money spent would stay somewhere else next time 
 the staff was rude the air blew cool the first night but warm the second night the temperature outside was not low enough for heat when my wife called the front desk the gentleman was rude and condescending to her when she asked if the air conditioning was switched to heat or was there something wrong with our unit i didnt appreciate his attitude especially for the amount of money i paid the staff needs more training don t plan to stay there again and definitely don t recommend this place
 bed was small i m   but was given what we think is the smallest room room in basement with no view and a noisy aircon outside 
 the room was very tiny i had to put my luggage on the bed to get my clothes the heater was not working 
 liked everything 
 we waited  minutes to start the checking in process while the two out of their depth receptionists struggled with a handful of guests despite the fact that we arrived late in the afternoon owing to a broken down train our room wasn t ready the guests lounge seemed to be permanently closed the employment of a concierge would have improved matters greatly 
 was building works and scaffolding one floor below us we really should have been informed when booking or checking in especially as the workmen started at   
 the room was super small and the bed was not comfortable the manager was nice enough to give us an upgrade to a bigger room but even that was too small to fit  adults and a one year old
 room service menu doesn t offer much and luggage took forever to be located after i had stored it on check out since i had an evening flight otherwise a great hotel more like home because of the warm reception 
 when we arrive after a long day we were told that i had booked two rooms which was incorrect there was only myself and me sister in law so we only needed one room we informed we would have to pay for both rooms until i spoke with an operator at your office and the hotel finally decided to cancel the extra room but for about an hour we were very worried that we had to pay for two rooms but got sorted in the end also no airport shuttle so should say so on ads 
 the room was ridiculously small considering it was advertised as a superior double i couldn t find and information on what the hotel offered a tad run down and dirty the area a bit gritty but close to a tube station 
 book the club room which didn t feel like one the first room they gave us was on the second floor behind another random door which held  separate rooms the room was not well furnished despite the price paid one side of the mattress has collapsed i called the front desk several times and it was always un answered i went to the reception where they are awfully understaff and waited for a good long mins before i could address the change of my room i was told that it was the last room and i can t make any changes i was told to go for my dinner and come back again to see if they could do a swap when i came back they offered me another club room down in the basement with a window facing a neon bright light shinning right into the room every single night thank god for the curtains the room was much smaller than the previous and reek of a mixture of dampness and new paint i was too tired and upset to even request for another room change 
 nothing
 rooms are really quite small which is ok for a couple of days but if you are staying for an extensive period it can be an issue 
 as previous reviewers have said the rooms are very small but for london this is probably typical upgrading to a club room provides access to the club lounge which has seating areas computers and a coffee tea station breakfast is a bit pricey as we were able to walk around the corner to a great little cafe and have a wonderful breakfast for half the price 
 rooms are small a bit of construction going on 
 bathroom size
 i had late check out and the staff came to the room asking to go out because was late and i dont know why start the fire alarm and only in my floor the rest of the hotel was without fire alarm
 the breakfast was pretty good i wish the eggs were cooked a little longer it seems people in uk like their eggs runny due to construction we were moved to sister property so we missed out on the character of the older property
 the room they gave me  very small and have  stairs between the bathroom and the bed it should not be used and kept as storage they changed the room the second dayafter i told them i will leave 
 hotel is under repair our room was in the lower ground floor with no natural light and was noisy the  nd room booked for our friends was rather small but being on th floor they could see out of the window 
 our room and bathroom and also the bed was very small for two people not even place to put the cloths or luggage when you entered into the room you had to be very careful not to fell down the stairs as the room was on a lower level than the corridor not very convenient when you opened the window you had depending where the wind came from probably food smell from all the restaurants around 
 the bed is a bit hard 
 size of the room was a bit small though for such location and money it s not a big deal
 the size of the room was very small and i was in a club suite 
 superior label for the room is a joke it was small with a standard size bed not a superior bathroom either the steps up to the main part of the room from the entrance came a a suprise 
 the room was very small with narrow stairs inside the room door leading up to the bed the floor was creaky and the walls were thin leading to noise from other rooms 
 scaffolding around the building typically the room was perfect for a singel traveller but would have been small for two exec double room wifi unstable and signal weak in room wish for more coffee in the room and a minibar no minibar in room 
 the rooms were incredibly small which was challenging for us travelling with a lot of luggage we were offered a club room but the extra space was minimal and the bathroom even smaller than in the standard 
 the smaller room is too small the exterior view is not great
 split level room with bathroom downstairs 
 room size i expect a superior double to be superior to something not to be told that is the standard size in what i can only describe as a box room 
 room was smaller than depicted no room for a chair just a small stool for suitcase very tiny bathroom no space for an ironing board room meant for a double but only suitable for one person 
 superior double room was tiny difficult to get in and out of the room steps down with a suitcase also no room to walk around the bed bathroom also tiny bath with no screen so when showering the entire bathroom was a big puddle the two lifts are small and one was out of action so the working one was very busy we had a train to catch so gave up waiting and struggled with our suitcase down the stairs 
 on arrival we were able to leave our bag and told our room would be available from pm great we thought that all fits with our plans however this relaxed feeling was short lived when we returned to check in later that day we were met with a long queue that took  minutes to process before we made it to the front only to be told the hotel was fully booked how we wondered could this be we d booked   months prior to our check in date and received confirmation our reservation had been confirmed we were informed that our booking would be honoured at a neighbouring hotel and a free taxi transfer would be arranged for us within  minutes  minutes later our taxi had not arrived and we noticed ours wasn t the only one that hadn t turned up so far we had been well over an hour a further  minutes later a taxi finally arrived and we were taken to a hotel only a few minutes away needless to say the other hotel dealt with us promptly on arrival but all the drama at check could if been avoided if only we had been told upfront 
 i didn t have an opportunity to sample this hotel as they had a mix up as they put it and sent us to another hotel the staff there were rude as they spoke in a foreign language whilst resolving the issue so i didn t know what was going on
 the bathroom was fairly compact although useable the view from our window was of the windows of another part of the hotel but you can t have everything 
 the room was very small when i booked the room it was a deluxe single room but actually i could not move inside it 
 on arrival we were met with a long que to reception when we did get served we were told they didn t have a room available for us due to maintenance work they said to go to the bar for a complementary drink and they would have a taxi pick us up and take us in  mins an hour and half later we were still waiting i asked them to get me a room in there hotel as other people were checking in they agreed and we ended up in a basement room which was very small tv didn t have a remote to operate it either it definatley was not a four star room or experience we had to que  mins to get into the breakfast room when we did get in they had no cerial bowls so we had to use dinner plates to eat fruit and yogurt they clearly were struggling to cope as the beans sausage bacon etc was all depleted at different times worst hotel experience for us for a long time shame as we were there for my wife s birthday 
 the breakfast was too busy and we had to sit separately subsequently you were asking for coffee and items that were running out on the buffet 
 room exceptionally small and could be construed as dangerous room was in a very confined space with  steep steps down to a miniscule bathroom with only just enough to squeeze in and i am of reasonably small build 
 the pictures of the hotel rooms bore little resemblance to the actual room in particular the size of the room they were exceptionally small to the point of being claustrophobic 
 it is our honey moon and we requested specials to our room nothing was being done for us extra small room for us while it says deluxe double room
 there were problems on arrival with our rooms we were asked if we could move hotels we selected the location to walk into hyde park the next day then the rooms were confirmed but only one out of the two rooms was made available by pm 
 we missed out on high tea on our last day we left it too late the night before but it was booked out by then so book it early 
 a four star hotel i don t think so just overpriced there was nothing special about it just four very thin walls and a bed lack of ambiance super small shower cabine my neighbor called home after midnight could hear his entire conversation glad we didn t stay for breakfast 
 rooms very small having to pay in advance made you feel like they didn t trust you also the fact that no one told us at check in that we had to pay in advance resulted in an embarrassing position when we were locked out of our room on asking reception why we could not get in our room we were told in front of a busy reception area that it was because we hadn t paid i would expect to pay in a yha but not in a hotel of this standard ii have stayed in many hotels around the world and never have i had to pay in advance 
 we were phoned during the day of our arrival to be told that they had room issues and we were being moved to another hotel after explaining we had a car in a nearby car park and that we had all been enjoying the festival we were at in hyde park so could not drive we were told there would be rooms in the grand royal when we did check in we were asked to pay for the room despite the fact the hotel had already pre authorised the full amount which had already been deducted from my card this meant that i was now  down for a  bill next came the rooms having booked a deluxe double room we were given a twin club room which was so small that two people moving around the room were constantly having to get on the bed or go into the bathroom to let the other past all through this staff were not very helpful and seemed to be basically clueless having listened to other people checking in and out and all the other complaints at reception i can safely say i do not believe anyone had a good stay this weekend very disappointing for a such a wonderful building in the main 
 the rooms were a bit small 
 only issue we has was on check in we didn t have the credit card that we used to make the booking as the card had been cancelled make sure you take the credit card that you use to make the booking this was sorted but frustrating bed in our room had broken springs but this was quickly resolved and we were given a new room straight away 
 we booked a superior double room which on the whole was fine however if we had been staying for more than  days it would have been very difficult to store suitcases ect as room was a tad on the small side
 trade off is the room is a bit cramped and the design leans to efficiency rather than comfort the finishes are starting to feel their age in the rooms themselves 
 when i arrived after  days of travelling i was told that my room would only be ready in  hours and that i should take a cab to one of their other hotels stay there for a day them repack and move back to the grand royale the rooms are all dirty dust on the skirting boards rooms are painfully small bathrooms are so small you battle to even dry yourself after a shower front office staff were abrupt unfriendly and seemed barely willing to assist with calling the manager one of the worst hotel experiences i have ever had in london 
 very noisy area and noisy hotel very small double rooms staff unable to help or call back regarding complaints no door man and no help with luggage upon arrival the room wasn t cleaned as well as expected 
 the bedroom was of reasonable size and bed comfortable but the shower was minuscule and the toilet difficult to access a larger person might have found it impossible to use there are steps at the front of the building and to some of the public areas handrails absent 
 the only thing i could think of was that its a bit pricy for what it was we booked this hotel because it was on offer through booking com at  off usual price otherwise we wouldnt have been able to afford it 
 the room was so small and dark it was unpleasant the shower was soooo small you couldn t move and i am not fat the worst hotel room we ve ever stayed 
 there is nothing i don t like about this hotel
 poor single glazed sash windows let in draughts i would definitely avoid during cold weather and noise the neighbours on the opposite side of the street decided to party outdoors until   we could hear everything clearly from the th floor with the window closed narrow corridors difficult with pushchair due to steps doors although staff will help if asked many steps including at the entrance in the corridors and even in the bedroom expensive breakfast so many good cafes in   min walking distance 
 mattress uncomfortable like it was old i could hear the tube till late view from window was a concrete courtyard room very small and no parking even though booking com said there was shower drenched the bathroom 
 room could have been bigger the bed was a little hard for my taste although it seemed good quality the th floor is not directly accessible by lift you have to go to the th and then up a couple of flights of stairs no minibar or fridge we stayed in a deluxe room 
 unfortunately i saw the mattress when the cleaners were changing the room and there was a large blood stain on it put me off a little 
 a little faster check in 
 i had read several bad reviews about overbooking and sending people to different hotel but i took a chance i had requested and early check in and we arrived very early am upon arrival i was told that a representative had tried to call me to tell me their was a problem with the hot water in my room and they had no room for me i quickly went into defense mode and told them that i had read this bad review about them and couldn t believe it was happening to me desk manager told clerk to call reservation and let them deal with it she called and told them i had read a bad review and they found a room for me but it wasn t ready they kept our luggage while we went to breakfast and said i was high priority to get in our room we returned about noon and it wasn t ready so we sat in the sitting room and waited and waited while waiting i heard various stories to incoming guests about the water and high priority to get in different rooms were offered as was free breakfast to other guests i kept checking on room progress and was finally told that the guests had just checked out and we would once again be high priority to get in we did get in our room at check in time and we had a nice room club room was what it was called it was in the basement but clean and nice we had a few drinks in fridge and basket of fruit tea and hot chocolate upon checkout two of us left early and one remained i stopped at desk and said that one person remained and i wanted to make sure nothing was owed as it shouldn t have anything assured we were paid up when last guest left they tried to charge her for breakfasts every morning she replied that she was told that all was paid and assured them we had not eaten breakfast we weren t charged the hotel made things right by my reservation but i am not sure i would stay again most of the staff was very nice and helpful 
 the bathroom was like a coffin and not a clean one at that the entrance of the hotel was lovely but the rest was awful you could have been in a travel lodge and saved some pennies very noisy at the front of the hotel 
 as the no disturbe ight was on at the room door they still called me in the middle of the morning to offer room cleaning every monday morning or so they said the hotel has a fire drill advanced warning could have been great so guests are not scared to death when it happens and nobody answers the phone at the reception 
 room was modern but very small for  people  lrg suitcase only  would fit lying down there was no lift very narrow staircase no porter also no fridge 
 room could have been a bit bigger but it was enough for us for a short break
 some of the staff is not fluent in english but they do try to be professional 
 the bedrooms are very small and the staff are too courteous lol 
 service on arrival felt that the staff member on reception was rude we arrived after pm and the room wasn t ready so we has to wait 
 long narrow maze of hallways and repeating corners to access rooms 
 booking through booking com did not give a breakfast option at  pounds per person times three people times three days this was quite significant booking directley through the hotel would have had breakfast included at the same rate
 clean an tidy but rooms walls are dirty and scratched room were small check in was late and hotel stuff didn t feel brothered about it so at end of oure trip i m not happy about place were i stayed in but location is really good 
 i did not like being at the front of the hotel we stayed for a few days at the back of the hotel and returned from a trip to be put at the front nicer view but no sleep as you can really hear the drunks shouting in the street
 the fruit bowl was limited there was only an orange banana and an apple 
 nothing
 a tiny noisy room very deceptively photographed 
 size of the rooms is small and i don t think management can now do anything about it 
 i didn t like the fact that the sink and bath wouldn t drain properly and would fill up and you would have to wait half an hour for the sink to drain 
 the room was a bit small the bathtub did not have a door or shower curtain so the whole bathroom got all wet from a shower also no fan in the bathroom the wifi was fine but not the greatest the usb port the room came with did not even work
 big room big bathroom
 we were given the broken boiler story too and they tried to move us to another hotel until i asked for the price difference to be refunded we paid  and the sister hotel was advertised at  we were suddenly found an available room at the current hotel also the room smelt of drains sewage
 tiny bathroom to be honest not suitable for the price of offer also very odd window blinds in our room meant there was never any daylight which i didn t like
 the presentation of the hotel is quite dark and dower the family rooms leave a lot to be desired saying it is small is a little bit of an understatement and also the room was very tired and needs total redecoration 
 i was sorry to leave but god willing i ll be able to swing by the grand royale before i leave 
 it took them almost half a hour to check me in and in that time  people complained who were not in front of me but were still served first i was ignored until i complained
 the room was very small there was hardly any room to stand between the bed and the window for the price we paid i would have expected breakfast to be included 
 checking out 
 the bathroom was too small i m small and struggled but my   partner found it far too cramped the staff gave an arriving guest the wrong key our room number so we had someone opening our door in the morning when when we were getting ready and didn t really appreciate that 
 the shower screen in our room was not big enough had to point the shower head at the bathroom wall and be careful moving so that water did not splash off me still ended up with a pool of water on the floor and the toilet had a bath the next day to avoid the hassle 
 we ll typical of london hotels small rooms though it s a  star bathroom dilemma no shower curtain the glass division was soo small thats why when u take a shower the whole bathroom is wet there s a smell stink but tolerable this matter was brought to the attention of the management they offer us to transfer to other room we we re at the basement then 
 when we arrived for a late night check in we were told that we were being moved to one of its sister hotels  minutes away the boiler had broken in the hotel they did not call us in advance and advise us of this problem they also had us sign a paper committing us to full  night reservation prior to disclosing the facility s maintenance issues and being required to move we were then transported at  p m to the other hotel where we were told we had to pay for the full  night stay without inspection of the room or area at that hour we had no choice but to make the payment we were then stuck in a basement apartment and all of the attractions we planned to visit were a  minute rail ride away we asked to be moved to a higher level family room and they were unable to support the request we called booking com to express our concern but were only told that we were committed to the reservation and had to stay at one of these two hotels we then agreed to be moved back to original one with the preferred location around  p m the next day we were moved back to the original hotel although i was told by the hotel s management that the room was located on the nd level and was lovely and would comfortably hold a couple with an  year old child the room was tiny much much smaller than most small european rooms worse yet it was filthy dirty the carpet walls windowsills and pullout couch were obviously soiled the courtyard area where the room looked out on was filthy also with garbage laying outside we have pictures to support this description it was shocking that we were not released from the reservation we have used booking com in the past but never again they should have helped us to find an appropriate hotel even if it cost us an additional investment 
 no comment 
 rooms are little small 
 we arrived after a long journey only to be told they were going to transfer us to one of their sister hotels in paddington when we objected they miraculously found a room for us 
 we were in a lower ground floor room with a window looking out to steps that go up to street level which was fine but the steps area had some building materials pallets etc lying there which could have been moved out of view shower was a bit small but fine to use 
 not happy with bookings com my reservation was excepted got to hotel and we had to stay somewhere else didn t have a choice in the matter as we had already travelled to london so there was no going back this wasn t the hotels fault 
 rooms were very small and they only service the room for your arrival then after your departure though in saying this i actually asked them to service it while we were out and they did only other negative wos that they gave us keys to a room already occupied so we walked in on another couple 
 the bathroom coiuld have been cleaned a little better each day 
 room was like a box literally no windows couldn t swing a kitten very claustrophobic would not consider staying here again 
 the area isn t as nice as the hotel but beyond the hotels control
 bathroom was very tiny not even a proper sink no breakfast included 
 they overbooked the hotel when we arrived there was a large gap under the door which made us feel the room was lacking in privacy the bathroom was actually caked in dust under the sink i saw this because i dropped a soap the shower didn t have a curtain or screen so water gushed everywhere the shower head also didn t stay in place everything about the place felt cheap and budget the rooms are tiny and it felt unclean i would have rather stayed in a holiday inn or premier inn worst hotel i ve ever stayed at 
 not all single rooms have a bathtub showers in some singles are very small by us standards normal for uk though 
 the bathroom was clean the  shower screen not a joke was hilarious and pointless and meant your shower contributed to a flooded floor each morning 
 room was very small also we would have loved to have dined in the restaurant but it is only open fur breakfast this is a real shame as i m sure it would be a lovely place to eat 
 rooms far too small booked a superior room but nothing superior about it bed was hard pillows were hard no sheets only a duvet that had seen better days shower leaked all over the bathroom due to inadequate screen 
 i couldn t actually like anything as my partner checked in and was told we had been moved to a sister hotel down the road the entrance was more like a budget hostel the room was so tiny the bed was against the wall so we had to climb over each other to get out after a sleepless night we selected the table in the basement breakfast room with the least damp coming through the wall absolutely disgusted at our treatment 
 we were moved hotels due to an electrical fault i understand this was out of the hotels control but the alternative accommodation was not in such a good location i d been looking forward to a drink in the grand looking reception area and a short walk to hyde park 
 the room was not very clean and was extremely hot couldn t open a window we were upgraded but it was a tiny room with a small bed there were cracks in the tiles it was in desperate need of a refurbishment
 a very small room but it was clean 
 on arrival i was sent to another hotel down the road by the girl on reception as there was a problem with the boiler and my room was not available although i asked for another room i was told there wasn t one that i would have to go to another hotel down the street for the first night that was of an equivalent standard when i got to the other hotel it was nothing like the one i d paid for and was aud cheaper per night i asked to be transferred back to the hotel i d paid for they did have another room the gentleman on the desk was very apologetic this all could have been avoided was very upsetting at the time fridge would be handy 
 room very tight to work around the bed and bathroom tight was expecting an iron in the room 
 basement room disappointing not represented in the advertised pictures 
 difficult to move around the room as the area around the bed was a bit tight 
 the new hotel was in an area where we did not want to be the hotel was fine apart from its location 
 no tv remote in room single room so tiny maybe i am naive but i still think  is a lot for a single basement room with no breakfast 
 very small room eapecially as it was a club deluxe very small bathroom could hardly move and staff customer service was not particularly friendly the reception area looked tired 
 the room size and access wasn t the best small with steep steps but it didn t detract from the positives i would still stay again
 fortunately we are not big people other wise the bedroom would have been hopeless about incs around either side so my husband just managed it the receptionist suggested we mention this in future 
 to be honest our stay was a nightmare from start to finish we arrived at the hotel to be told that someone had been trying to contact us they hadn t and that we were being moved to a cheaper different hotel when we had picked this one due to its beauty my husband had to complain that we were still being charged the original price and being moved to a cheaper room so we were upgraded but the staff kept changing their mind about where we were going to be staying first telling us to move then that we were staying then again that we were moving we had to complain to get upgraded to a suitable room in the other hotel and the staff were disorganised and slow i am hugely disappointed as this was our wedding anniversary 
 room and en suite were very small for two adults i lay on the bed with the suitcase to give floor space to my wife standing in a bath on a non slip mat to shower is not acceptable nowadays booking com not the hotel website lists parking beware this hotel does not have parking however i was directed by reception to a nearby underground carpark 
 room was smaller than appeared in pictures and there were steps inside the room entry way which are a tripping hazard interior of hotel is beautiful but worn in places 
 room was very small and cramped although en suite was adequate housekeeping staff slam doors constantly during the afternoon 
 the single room although they said they had upgraded it to their largest single for my birthday was still but rather small and claustrophobic very hot you would not want to linger too long in that confined space
 there was a slightly bad smell in the second room we didn t say anything as we were not in the room very much and were so glad to have the bigger room 
 incredibly small room so much so that we were a a couple with two medium size suitcases between us and it was too tight to have both on a stand each and the two of us bending over repacking without bumping into one another can t swing a cat or pack a suitcase
 the lock on room door was broken window latch broken
 very very small rooms a bit like sleeping in a cupboard it was all very comfy but very cramped 
 asked for upgrade twin club got a double and at  pm had to try to split the twins and reset the room it was in the basement they offered to move us but after unpacking it was too much of a hassle they did give an apology note water and fruit in our room the next day
 needs a smartening up of its appearance but then it s in bayswater not mayfair 
 pillow and bed too hard and room too confined especially bathroom however upon request they gave me a soft pillow nice if sports had been shown on tv but available at nearby pubs
 small room with a small bed but slept well with extra comforter 
 slightly small bedroom but i guess that is london 
 rooms average size but had all facilities 
 price is on the expensive side but you get what you pay for which is a fantastic hotel 
 despite paying for an upgrade the room was extremely small there was only a narrow staircase leading to the first floor and corridors leading to the room were a tight squeeze 
 rooms a bit cramped no fridge marked walls furniture in the room interfering works yard below the window
 our room was tiny i found some difficulties moving around inside the room but i guess it was the value for money condition 
 there was some issue at the hotel and on our first night we had to sleep in a partner hotel of theirs though the quality was good the atmosphere of the room and breakfast area were not on par and we did not enjoy it that much we did return to our original hotel for the second night and were happier there 
 i tried to ask the reception staff for restaurant recommendations in london which they seemed to know little about 
 they stuck us in the basement for   for  nights they could not give us at least first floor the wifi did not work in the basement very well so for a week i could not comfortably contact friends and family in the states after a long day the desk people were very snooty and the tickets they booked for shows and attractions we could have bought cheaper anywhere else do not book anything with them or believe their advice on anything i had to figure everything out on my own very hard to do with no wifi they advertised an airport shuttle but no they do not have one false advertising cost   pounds to get to the airport all they offer is a bed a bathroom and a pretty lobby the women at the desk seemed to not have a clue about anything in their city and seemed quite content to just stand there and give bad advice maybe if you looked like their next suger daddy they would fawn all over you but if you are a woman from the usa forgetaboutit 
 i was extremely annoyed that the bill did not add up yo the number of days times the rate displayed by booking com the rate changes as the week progresses warning
 the room was supposed to be a superior double room it wasn t at all the window wouldn t open properly and we complained they wanted to give us another romm but as we had so little time there we didn t want to move as our days were planned you could hardly walk next to hat ebed to get to the window or get into bed for this price not including breakfast the hotel was very unsatisfactory a terrible cheek i would definitely want some money back i would never go to this hotel again they are cheats 
 sunday morning breakfast manic busy staff were great but other guests who could see people waiting just sat and enjoyed their rd helping of food guys it s not an all you can eat other rude quests who think they are too important to queue at check out desk
 there were steps in our room right after you enter it do request for another room if this is of inconvenience to you otherwise this is a great hotel to stay 
 standard rooms are so small that two people need to carefully choreograph their moves to get dressed or go to the restroom 
 tge roome size is very small the bathroom high is short for me at least 
 room was very small we were placed on the lower ground floor no views could have told us a poor way to end a  week european vacation picturing on the web very deceiving 
 ordered and paid for a large wine and was given a small one bar busy could have been an error and didn t was to cause a scene
 the room was small but so comfortable and nice beautiful place 
 i didn t like that i got a flower delivery that was never delivered to my room and that when my friend called to inquire no staff member thought to check delivery room flowers were found after i went home money lost for my friend who sent them
 i stayed  nights all was fine left to go to peaks region when returned was notified my  night reservation was cancelled was told by staff my credit card was rejected it was same card that was used  nights for earlier stay had a hassle getting rebooked at different hotel found out later from another guest that hotel had water leak and needed to move customers to different hotel did not appreciate being told my credit card was the problem when clearly it was not 
 the room was too small and the linen had several pubic hairs stuck to the sheets which made feel very sick i am not sure if the sheets had been changed from the previous guest 
 the fact they took the money from my bank account several days prior to our arrival especially when it was said we can pay at the hotel upon arrival and then having to wait days for any refunds to be put back into our bank account 
 for the price of  for one night to be told that this did not include breakfast was shocking although when i complained the manager did allow us to have breakfast also the photos of a superior double room on the website did not live up to the reality of a very small drab room where there was barely enough room to walk around the bed there is more room and comfort in a budget hotel than this and as it was a birthday treat for my daughter we were very disappointed we won t ever come here again and it was not worth the money i will go with the budget option next time 
 sent to park grand paddington hotel room was very small no cupboard space no fridge no iron bed made in the am but bathroom not cleaned or towels changed no mini bar very very disappointed not given a discount considering we paid almost double to stay at the grand royale hype park compared to the hotel we were sent too for  nights 
 be careful when booking the total i paid by far exceeded the sum of the days times booking com s price it went up and up each day quite unfair to a trusting soul who did not add up my own bill before clicking warning to others 
 room very small and we had to wait almost an hour for sandwiches when we ordered room service the manager did say sorry for this in the morning to be fair but no good to us as we were very hungry the night before we also went to the bar for a night cap and they had no bailys cream so we went to our room very disappointed 
 chaos at check in room not ready got back bag had not been taken to room no to remote room so small even i was off edge of bed im only just over ft couldn t move air conditioning didn t work this was meant to be a delux double
 bar closed to residents at  pm no snacks available   min wait for reception to service a drink snack request after  pm rooms very small 
 the bar closed at  and the barman did not ask anyone if they would like more drinks the bar was full he proceeded to close the shutter and walk out would of liked notice more revenue for the hotel as most of the residents would of purchased another drink 
 invited to wait for our room to be ready by having a drink in the bar waited  minutes for bar staff but no one arrived to serve us 
 the so called superior double room that was booked turned out to be the smallest room we have ever stayed in for a hotel which was not satisfactory for the price we paid although on the door it stated club room and not a superior room also we checked in at   hr and returned at   hr to be told that there was a minimum of a  hour wait for our baggage to be taken to our room when they had all day to do this knowing what our room number was once cleaned and available we also once in the room and the hour was up had to call reception twice to find out when our bags would be delivered 
 room was tiny no where near what i would expect from a superior room been in london premier inn s that were literally twice the size 
 paid for a double superior room but it certainly did not feel like a superior had to walk down a flight of stairs to get to the bedroom and there was hardly any space to move around the price of the room was too much for what we had 
 the room was snug not too room to walk around the bed and the scrambled eggs didn t really resemble scrambled eggs 
 room was tiny very disappointed completely different from the pictures
 price view from bedroom over a noisy and untidy back yard 
 the staff never smiled and only ever said  words to me the whole time i was there i also got a poor view of their ventilation system for the money i paid i did not deserve a view of their ventilation 
 the room is way too small including the bathroom lighting was also poor 
 we did have a small issue with the staff being unable to locate our luggage which was left with them on the day we were leaving this was resolved but still did worry me at the time 
 a little tired needs an up grade but must retain character our superior room had little floor space no chairs to sit on no space by the bed you had to get on the bed from the front surely you can t call this superior but still liked the overhaul character 
 the room is small and there s no elevator to the th floor 
 they left us outside of the room one day before check out because we have been told that we hadn t paid at the check in when they forgot to ask us for the entire payment and asked for the first night after many discussions with the hotel manager we have been allowed access to the room they said they tryed to reach us via phone many times and this is absolutelly false
 the room had all you would expect but v small and no natural light expensive for what it was had i had a better room i would have been v happy with hotel
 the room  was very small for a double the bed was barely a double and there was hardly any space around the bed there was a very shallow single wardrobe which was of little use the bathroom sink was so impractical that water went everywhere when you tried to use it this should not be classed as a  star hotel in my opinion the reception staff seemed more interested in having a good time than in helping guests 
 i think we were downgraded to the basement even though booking was for a deluxe double the receptionist mumbled something about it when we checked in the room and en suite were tiny but clean 
 room was far too small even for london standards you could not leave the case stand up as there was no where physically to put it a few feet more in the rooms would be less greedy this was a superior room 
 had to change rooms due to being put in what almost seemed like a cupboard with no window and no room for our luggage being six months pregnant this wasn t acceptable as the room was very stuffy so we asked to change rooms new room was more spacious with a window but did have dirty marks on wall and very hard bed which was uncomfortable 
 bed was uncomfy room was very small even though i booked a deluxe certain areas in need of decoration no extractor fan in bathroom and it floods when in shower due to small screen 
 staff seamed very busy which caused them to forget about letting us know when our room was available so check in wasn t the time we expected which was very disappointing 
 room was a little on the small size but adequate 
 some minor maintenance issues no teabags on hospitality tray and curtain not hanging correctly so letting light in from early morning some public areas in need of tlc bar prices steep  for a diet cole and a soda water 
 the room was very small despite being upgraded we did move to a similar grade room with a different layout but still short on space but never mind we were there to attend a concert and sightseeing london is amazing the black cab drivers were so friendly and chatty made us laugh 
 on the day we were to check in i missed a call at am letting me know that due to a boiler issue our booking would be transferred to a sister hotel in paddington for our entire stay having googled this boiler issue i found that many other previous guests had the same experience noting that in their experience this was in fact an overbooking issue rather than any boiler upon arrival at the hotel i was told that a taxi would be called for us and we could check in at the sister hotel i asked if there was a member of management i could speak to about this matter i expressed my dissatisfaction and how the substitute hotel was not somewhere that i had chosen to stay i also cited the many booking com reviews about this boiler that i had found i was told that this was just something that happened to the  hotel boilers please note that guests were both checking in and out during this time after causing quite a fuss at reception the hotel found us a room in the hotel one would imagine that this would have been done in the first instance rather than relocating a guest however i was happy that my original booking had then been honoured 
 cockroach running across the carpet uncomfortable mattress rubbish outside the window being put in the basement shower so small you couldn t bend down to pick up the soap
 the weather but hey its england in summer 
 the bath shower water rained out onto the floor there was no shower curtain glass barrier to keep the water in the tub caused more than the usual anxiety during use of the bathroom 
 booked  rooms double deluxe st room had obviously had smokers in next room damp then settled for last room very small not sure where deluxe was also booked  other deluxe double rooms which were allocated to our colleagues when we arrived as they informed us of room numbers when colleagues arrived their rooms apparently had no hot water then rooms were locked and then had been given to other people they ended up in tiny single rooms not what we paid for they made us late for a very important appointment it seemed like this group of hotels were shipping people in and out of sister hotels not at all happy 
 nothing
 the room size and the bed are quiet small but that s how it is in most london i feel terrible for big sized people fitting in is a hassle 
 tried to move us to a sister hotel that was in a terrible location so we made them shuttle us back wasting about an hour rooms tiny staff rude 
 that is possibly the smallest room i have ever stayed in at a hotel and i have stayed in a few and we were upgraded to a larger room i really didn t think you could cram a shower bath and toilet and basin into m but they managed it it was nice and clean but it was absolutely tiny and given the cost isn t cheap it is a big let down from the main part of the hotel 
 buyer beware bait and switch they tried to switch my reservation to another hotel charge me the same rate but the hotel they tried to move me to was a lesser hotel that would normally charge half the price i saw them doing this to other travelers too 
 the rooms and bathrooms are tiny house keeping didn t change the sheets once in the  nights i was there 
 rooms are very small 
 it was fine fr me but the superior room was on the small side and i can imagine for larger folks this would be a bit oppressive 
 the room was too small the walls were marked to the point it s the first thing you notice about the room unfortunately the room was a   at the very very most i left after a few hours 
 hmm the room appeared to be a bit smaller than we thought the interesting thing was that we had to climb a few steps after opening the door to a our room which is just enough to fit in a small writing desk a double bed and a bathroom the splash glass of the bathtub is too small we had to be carefully not to wet the floor interesting experience afterall p
 staff in breakfast area abrupt and no customer interaction or smiles queue for breakfast took over  mins to be seated facilities are very small
 moved to another sister hotel due to water leakage problem but driver dropped me at the wrong place room too small reserved for double bed but they gave me one small single bed 
 rooms and bathrooms were a bit small but everything was provided for so no worries 
 no porter at front door hard for some drag big bag up 
 our room was rather small we also had to go down a flight of stairs as soon as you open the door the door open in word and there was not enough room on the landing for person in the door 
 the room a superior deluxe was the smallest room i ve ever stayed in very little space two adults could not stand either side or at the end of the bed together more of a single than a double let alone a superior deluxe 
 i was very annoyed with the check in they wanted to move me to another partner hotel in paddington due to problem with heating they rang earlier in the day suggesting this i completely refused and was eventually given a room in this hotel but i dislike the way this was done and it was almost a favour to give me the room i had booked 
 tiny rooms repeated requests to hotel staff to provide extra coat hangers which eventually arrived a couple of hours later rip off prices in the bar  for a single gin and tonic no window able to be opened for fresh air air con noisy this room was the biggest room i d refuse to stay in the smaller rooms paid  per night but could ve got it for  if i d booked a couple off days before 
 it wasn t really a problem for  night but the bathroom was really small very clean and well maintained though 
 normally i am critical of london hotels but this one has no problems at all
 according to the escape map behind the door i believe my room should be the smallest in this hotel there are even no place for me to open the luggage
 description of rooms superior deluxe and club none of them were applicable to the rooms we were shown the club room should be graded standard
 the room was tiny i am pretty sure they did not measure it accurately always getting in each others way the bathroom was also a nook and not much hanging room 
 the room is fairly small compared to other hotels i stayed in london before the hairdryer is really old the rear side is widely open no mesh filter which is almost a given in any recent design i got a chunk of my hair sucked in had to ask for a scissors to cut my hair 
 very small cosy bedroom bathroom 
 everything did not enjoy my  nights stay and wouldn t recommend to anyone i was on business so my company was paying if i had to use my own money i woukd give it a rating of minus  not a happy customer
 did not have any evening service in restaurant also the menue for room service was very limited
 i don t think guests should be offered a discount just to pre book breakfast anyone paying to stay should be offered breakfast at the same price 
 small rooms i mean very smell we couldn t even walk around the bed and that s all the space we had impossible to get undressed or move about bathroom was even worse we did get a refund on our breakfast due to complaining about our room 
 there was no changing room or area in the toilets for guests who had already booked out and had baggage stored for the day 
 don t be disillusioned by the pretty pictures staff was rather rude to us and lacked complete understanding of english language none of the staff appeared to be native speakers room was extremely small and we had to use a stairs to get from bathroom to sleeping area which also makes the space advertised as larger than it really is even being a very slim person myself i couldn t reach the other side of the bed without moving the furniture window could not be opened as it was half covered by the balcony wall and floor the air conditioning was very dusty 
 the superior room which we were supposed to have was a little small and the  or  steps down to the bathroom were a little inconvenient but not so bad as to spoil our stay 
 the mattress was ok but not as comfortable as it could be i cannot recommend this hotel for those with ambulatory issues because there is no access other than stairs at the entrance there were also stairs to enter my room but i understand there are other rooms without otherwise a hidden gem 
 the price we paid for our stay we were disappointed with the room we thought it was on the small side and the bathroom was compact also for the price i think breakfast should have been included 
 i cannot fault this hotel at all 
 the room was on the lower level and was very small and the bathroom was tiny the shower stall was  x  my   husband could barely stand up in it and it would have been impossible for him to raise his arms to wash his hair so ridiculous not worth over  a night 
 room was tiny and had to enter up staircase immediately inside room door and shower sprayed all over bathroom due to tiny shower screen
 the room was very small and the green security light over the door was much too bright i could not sleep because of this 
 certain reception staff less than helpfull cleaning supervisor agressive manager advised who gave his attention 
 there was no phone signal in my room which made me stressed of not being able to receive important phone calls 
 the bathroom was really small hate small bathrooms but then we only really slept in the room so weren t there really as we were out all day 
 i expected to get body lotion and had to purchase some at a nearby store only shower gel and shampoo was provided 
 the room we stayed in was in need of a bit of a refurb the wallpaper looked tatty and blinds were broken this was a little disappointing and i did contemplate asking to be moved however we were on a tight schedule for the day so didn t want to get upset over it rooms are very small 
 the lavatory is incredibly small i was living in the room  which is a so called club room if you are a big guy and right handed you will absolutely find it difficult cleaning yourself after using the toilet
 on arrival had to wait to check in and was then asked to move to another hotel i firmly refused and was promptly allocated a room i asked staff to confirm my booking of a superior double would be honoured i was told it would be room so small i had to climb over bed to get into it it was however comfortable and i will no doubt use the hotel again even though i am still not sure if the room i got was a superior double how small must a standard double be 
 i found the room a bit cold and the thermostat did not seem to be controlled from the room 
 the only negative is that the restaurant is not open in the evening but there are plenty of eateries nearby
 towels were so rough they exfoliate with every use sheets could use some fabric softener too 
 noise from fellow guests unhappy baby next door 
 nothing
 we were very disappointed in the size of the room even though we chose a superior double room also very disappointed in view from our window which was a very scruffy block of flats
 a room that was a matchbox for my money superior room not dirty nets curtains dated decor untidy paintwork shabby and marked scuff marks no water in room for a star hotel website very misleading have you seen the rooms on the  th floor wouldn t put my pet up there would not recommended this hotel even with my last breath i felt i wasted my money and time staying there it was disgusting for a four star hotel the entrance is one big front and not in a good way shaftsbury hotels will not ever be on my list to stay in ever again 
 only a little point the shower screen in our room could of been a little bigger to avoid wetting the floor so much
 we had to wait around half hour for our room to be prepared even though we could check in after  we still had to wait although the staff we re apologetic and offered us tea and coffee it was still a nuisance to wait longer the bed was comofortable unfortunately there was holes in walls and black marks on the wall that was a little disappointing 
 the room size and consequently the double bed were really small and somewhat restricting on movement so much so i could not pass my wife in any part of the room without one of us having to our move aside for the other the view out of the window was none existent as it was directly onto a wall less than m away
 the fact because we booked threw you and ndt the hotel direct we had to pay  each for breakfast even though the hotel says breakfast is free for all our guesrs
 sheets were not changed even when we put in a request with the receptionist who said she would have it seen to we had spilled coffee and would have appreciated our sheets changed but they were not its the only things that was not perfect 
 aost perfect just a warning they re isn t a huge vegetarian cooked breakfast options no vegi sausages but there is lots if choice for other breakfast things so it s not a problem
 room not as spacious as would have liked 
 a lot of stairs but the staff upgraded my room to a ground floor room lifts do not go to all floors
 nothing to fault
 the rooms are really tiny which does not make it a value for mony hotel 
 room was very small decor rather shabby shower screen too small therefore floor got very wet 
 staff that don t speak english well seems to be the trend in london that the service industry is filled by eastern europeans that cannot convey ideas or understand queries inconvenient small rooms with even smaller bathrooms had a room on th fl which is reached via elevator to the th and then a snakey passage with steps anyone over average size would not be able to move in these rooms and the hallways are claustrophobic the closet so small that  days worth of clothes wouldn t fit shoes had to stay on the floor behind the door which had a great expanse of wall begging for a row of hooks for coats and sundries those we had to lay on the suitcase rest the desk in the corner was essential to laying things down the kettle and the hairdryer in the drawer however too close to the bed kept hitting my toes and hips on the corner it could have used a mini fridge underneath the last and most important thing for any hotel is a comfortable bed these were   beds smaller than a double and hard as rock i ordered an extra comforter to place on top it helped somewhat 
 room size very small bathroom you couldnt physically get in without having to stand over the toilet to close the door bar very basic poor quality of towels bed sheets etc 
 room was very small difficult getting in and out the bed so close to the window view was awful 
 the room was absolutely tiny you couldn t even really walk the windows couldn t be closed so it was freezing cold and extremely noisy in the room moreover the air con didn t heat the room either the furniture is old and totally worn down scratches and marks everywhere the shampoo is a joke it s like it s gluing your hair together so you can t brush it anymore no conditioner has been provided generally it s a very dark and uninviting hotel i don t understand why people rate it so high i will not come back definitely not  stars in my opinion 
 creaky floors uncomfortable pillows leaking iron one staff member who delivered my iron when i asked does this not come with a board replied grumpily i was told to only bring iron and walked off in a huff to get an ironing board 
 basement room so i was disinclined to open window for air security wise outlook awful also noisy fridge buzzing away all night in cupboard beside bed
 stuff poor very slow to check in the room very very small not as in the picture looks bigger and the bed very small for two the room was not very clean and towels really old and not clean well i will never come back to this hotel as all 
 toilet was positioned so it could not be used for what it was designed for therefore we had to go elsewhere to use the toilet 
 i don t like to complain but the room was on the small side 
 bedroom was far too small and the bathroom was so small that you cannot get in without closing the door after you step halfway in just no space and silly steps right at the bedroom door to get to the bed 
 the price should come down by at least   a little extortionate i thought 
 place was a little noisey and the deluxe room was very small for the price the bed was hard 
 well given it wasn t the hotel i booked i can t really say much about it despite having booked  days earlier and despite the hotel looking pretty busy i was shifted hotels because of a supposed boiler fault not being a tourist and staying all too regularly in london hotels i realise this is code for we ve overbooked the nicer hotel and shunt guests to the quieter hotel round the corner after we ve filled all the rooms it happens too often for me just to be an unlucky traveller  for the room breakfast on top and a room that to be fair was tidy but certainly not comparable with other similarly rated hotels that i stay in 
 cleaners walking in when i m half naked fire alarms going off first thing but no one bothered to say it was a mistake the room was awful 
 the room was tiny no bath the access to the room was blocked but staff did not tell me about the correct way to reach my room i was enrolled onto some premium club without explanation 
 i arrived late to be told had an upgrade to a room with a king size bed after the worlds slowest check in i opened my room door to find two twin beds i phoned reception to ask to be moved to a room with a double bed that i had booked reception informed they had no more rooms available however they would make my twin beds into a double the lady on reception and a waiter arrived to make the bed it took them  minutes meaning i didn t get into my room until  pm a night check out was incredibly slow the lady on the desk took around  minutes to check people out 
 upon arrival tried to shift our booking across to a sister hotel in paddington no explanation why but we refused given our triple deluxe room which was really poor cramped room was tatty and looked onto a square concrete storage area full of drinking water containers manager offered concessions in an attempt to satisfy hotel is grand but room we experienced was  star 
 told i had been upgraded to a large double from a single not enough room to open wardrobe door and you only had access to one side of the bed 
 perhaps the addition of other spaces like a gym ballroom or other public facilities would make it more appealing to more travelers 
 the room which is supposed to be their deluxe room slightly bigger than the superior rooms according to this web site was way too small the facilities were not satisfactory no mini bar and no gym 
 cleanliness a little lacking dried globs of white stuff on drapes would not care to guess origin didn t notice until i pulled them shut too tired to change rooms 
 the room was exceptionally small you would not want to share this room with another person the shower didn t have a full screen so the bathroom floor got very wet no towel available to step onto from shower stairs going down into the room were very dangerous especially as i wasn t warned 
 air con didn t work shower head was loose run out off wine and beer meant to be a double room ended up being to single beds poorly spoken english speaking staff 
 the floors squeezed a lot because of this we had to move from th floor to th floor 
 superior double room over egging the description somewhat the rooms were small and cramped 
 a little more room 
 rooms are not spacious but typical for london otherwise room was fine 
 could have supplied more toiletries in the room room was small 
 one of our party was moved to a sister hotel after his room allegedly had no hot water we were not informed of this till check in i paid  for him a double delux room and what he actually got was once moved a shoe box they even tried to charge us again for the room on more the one occasion ordered room service  times none of which were correct my partner is dairy intolerant the sandwich she ordered had cheese in it even though it did not say that on the menu we were assured it would be removed from the bill howver we were charged on check out check out is noon but was woken at  am by housekeeping wanting to clean our room 
 the building is very old so not very practical for disabled or elderly guests as there are steps into the building and steps on each floor although there is a lift 
 we had read some bad recommendations about this hotel usually redirects to their clients to other hotels overbooking for sure this was true as soon as we arrived they tried to do it i needed to confirm my pregnancy in order they took  minutes in giving as a room i think this is not very professional my husband also confirmed  months before that weekend was my birthday and their hotel was part of my present and nobody had any deference about it we also ask for an additional blanket on sunday and we needed to call twice to front desk in order they brought it we had it after almost  hour 
 the small chunky cups and saucers bigger mugs please now i am being picky 
 nothing
 room very small despite being called a deluxe double feet hanging off the end of the bed bathroom small difficult to stand under the shower which mostly went on the floor also had open staircase in the room at the foot of the bed 
 rooms rather small but that s london very poor selection of tv stations bring your tablet and netflix 
 very squeaky floors both in own room and room above heard the noise from the corridor very easily too 
 the room quality is really bad very small and even there s no room available i was relocated to other address wasting much time and complicated 
 i was upgraded with no extra perks not sure how that is an upgrade did not find the staff to be as helpfull in fact one did not seem interested rooms need a paint as there is cracks in the ceiling
 nothing
 quite expensive for what you get tiny room smaller than the cruise cabin we just finished the entire room tilted yes tilted 
 the bar had no amaretto two days running which was a disappointment to my guest club room very small bathroom tiny not a great view
 the room was extremely small for a twin room and very hot at night as they turn off the ac centrally and the room  only had a small window the young was closed for functions 
 very small bathroom with a very very tiny sink
 rooms are size of the locker and with the stairs onsude a m rooms feels like you are in the attic 
 room was very small altough i got a better category and noisy from the floor above the bathroom was extremely small it was hard to close the door with me inside the room was a bit strange with stairs between the bathroom and the actual bedroom the windows also hadn t any view that with the room size it became a bit claustrofobic 
 the maid tried to just walk into the room in the morning without knocking which i found to be rude and unprofessional 
 room sizes were quite small we booked a superior room only to discover that this was equivalent to a standard room elsewhere
 club room was a bit small but perfectly adequate for a  night stay 
 nothing i was impressed by all and everything concerning the staff they were helpful in providing information about how to get around london it s transit system 
 the room was on the small size
 room small but hey this is london
 no signal for mobile lower ground floor always had to come out of building to make a phone call 
 the air con seemed to make a bad smell come into the room at one point which we reported it disappeared when we turned it off 
 we booked double supreme but were allocated with a twin double on top of that room was no way near dusted we could see that dust flying all over in the room next night was far better because we got a club room yet again with twin single beds but room nice tidy spacious 
 the rooms are small there is not enough space to move around 
 room slightly small but comfortable and well presented 
 the room is very small it is hard to walk if we open just one luggage the bed is also very small and uncomfortable if you live underground it could be so depressive 
 the air circulation was pretty bad in our room the small window only opened a tiny bit and this was a cause of discomfort due to lack of fresh air 
 on arrival they offered an upgrade to what they said was a larger room the room was the size of a shoe box and the bed was described as a double to which it wasn t at one point in the night i woke up with my partners elbow in my mouth as literally no room in the bed definitely not worth  for  night and not even breakfast oh and the shaver sockets don t work
 our room was quite small but included bed desk and bathroom with very little space 
 my room was very small but to be expected for a london hotel 
 i upgraded from a standard room but what i got was still pathetic a room no bigger than x with a pretend window that opened into a corridor i shudder to think what i would ve had if i hadn t upgraded 
 came for an early check in but the room was not ready staff had told to wait in the front lounge but never came back for any updates 
 room was a bit on small side but obviously you don t spend much time in there   charge for large bottle of water think that s probably normal for room service but tad overpriced in my opinion
 the room and bathroom are very tight impossible to walk between the bed and furniture suitcases on the floor bathroom sink is ridiculously small with pullout bed in this suite there is no room to get around this is not really a hotel no dining room only used for breakfast the lobby sitting room is dark and not our taste adam s family gothic not a good sign to see people standing on the doorsteps smoking when we arrived looking out the window of pullout bedroom window is no joy dirty and stack of empty water bottles 
 ref room   strong noise specially from bathroom s ceiling spreading into bedroom at night seriously disturbing proper sleep cause aeration system  poor lightening system 
 poor room location being on the basement and below ground level so didn t have much of a view difficult to communicate with staff seemed to be due to a lanuage barrier 
 despite initial appearance and online room photos room was very small for the price paid and compared to what was shown and expected for this  star hotel dissappointing
 nothing
 staff were friendlier this time than last but a smile would still make all the difference just do some basic staff training in courtesy and friendliness 
 needs complete renovation very shabby short beds literally although i m not a tall person m blinds were broken even in the superior room 
 the room was incredibly small so was the bed my husband is over ft so half his legs were hanging off the end 
 i was greeted with the information there was no accommodation for me that i would have to be accommodated in a sister property there was mild surprise i had not received prior informatio but that did not ring true i politely but firmly refused alternative premises and guess what a room materialised i needed to be in that area for personal reasons but that is beside the point i had booked in inverness terrace because that was where i wanted to be this was poor stuff and i would like your comments as the booking agents you have always served me well in the past moira lawson
 the club room an upgrade was very small especially the bathroom it took a bit of getting used to but the pros still outweighed the cons we re coming back in june 
 headroom in shower also two inch gap at bottom of bedroom door had to fill gap with towel to stop light flooding in when we put lights off 
 the rooms are extremely small as i had booked superior double i was disappointed but didn t let it ruin the trip i suppose this is to be expected in london for the price 
 the room was very very small upon arrival i was told that i was upgraded to club room this room was extremely small god only know the size of my original room 
 it rained on the monday 
 the room was very very small didnt have any great expectations but i could almost touch all  walls while sitting on the double bed 
 mattress needs replacing sagging in the middle and could feel a spring couldn t open blinds 
 couldn t find a remote control and could not activate the air con 
 room was very small but the price was good so i guess that reflects the room size
 noisy road works quite early in the morning maintenance came to look at the shower whilst i was in it room wasn t all that big and we d been upgraded but was fine for what we needed 
 the bathroom was small though and a large person would have had very little space in the shower 
 too much noise around the room contact the duty manager but never reported back i had to call hik another  times to send someone to check it very noisy at all time in morning 
 ineffective heater in the room shower cubicle too small and close to the ceiling very small rooms being told that the hotel was too full and i would have to move to a hotel close by 
 nothing to report
 we were told that our room had been upgraded i would not have liked to stay in the previous one the room was very small and had no air conditioning making it very hot 
 we did have to move due to not having a double twin as booked but they moved us to a sister hotel in the area included breakfasts and couldn t be more apologetic or helpful 
 the only thing i would say is the room was very small really not what i expected for a club double could have have also done with a little decoration in places might be a good idea to put on the website that the rooms are small one other small thing was that there were complimentary drinks in the fridge but no bottle opener to open them with
 tiny rooms and unfortunately i had an unpleasant case with staff on reception my friend left for me a handbag on reception at evening and receptionist promised her to bring it to my number next day in the morning they ensured me that there was nothing for me left so after spending  minutes with all of members on reception they finally found my bag it was directly on the table in front of them i didnt expect that this could happen in london 
 yes rooms are compact lol but very clean and to be fair when you visit london you are only really putting your head down so don t actually spend that much time in the room well i don t anyways 
 the location is good the building lay out is very nice most of staff are v nice friendly the room was so basic in facilities like tea coffee shower gel body cream which was none the towels bed sheets smell really bad to the extent that i develop skin rashes the mattress pilows were uncomfortable 
 i booked a club room which in itself was fine along with the little extras but the bathroom the sink was so small why bother when i leant over to try and brush my teeth and rinse my face the stupidly placed glass shelf above stopped me what idiot designed that love the hotel but paying for a club room and getting a bathroom cupboard is just not acceptable the bathroom could have been made   metre wider and had a decent wash basin puts me off staying again
 old style windows were in a fixed position they could not be opened or closed gaps in the window frames allowed noise from the street to be heard clearly in the room at day and at night draughts could also be felt coming through the windows the hotel restaurant was only used for breakfast only rather expensive room service was available at other times of the day handy to have lots of stores and restaurants in the next street so you can pop out and get food for yourself 
 having a laugh to describe the room as a deluxe double open door and immediately faced with a flight of stairs up to the bed area which you had to negotiate separately as no room to swing a cat bathroom equipment ok but pokey for a deluxe 
 working desk space in room not really usable because to small 
 the size of the room of course we re in london and i ve slept even in smaller rooms but still i can t help but find it extremely annoying can t really have space for the suitcase no minibar and the desk is really impossible to use without feeling contrained there was a nasty damp smell in the room the windows are rather old ok so s the building but the draft coming from outside was not pleasant thankfully the heavy curtains helped 
 a little cold at night because i did not find the air conditioning regulator until the morning my own fault but the print is small 
 breakfast was quite expensive 
 instructions to switch on the heating air con could be improved and be made more readily available alongside the other hotel information in the room 
  no refrigerator in the room had to keep some food i bought with the receptionist  the lower ground floor room was noisy because of poor insulation i could hear people who were walking on the pavement  no shower curtains  very small room 
 the room was besides the housekeeping store up from  am it was loud and hard to sleep 
 better quality toiletries even if it s an additional cost eg overnight toiletries from moulton brown or another quality make would have saved me the hassle of bringing my own 
 tiny room with no view but at least they made an effort at cheerfulness by placing flowers in the windows that you look out at 
 there seemed to be huge communication difficulties we asked at booking for two twin rooms or if that was not possible then two single duvets on each double bed acquiring the single duvets seemed to be the most difficult thing in the world to achieve i lost count of how many attempts it took but it included getting two extra double duvets for each room various doubles and singles and eventually two singles arrived with two duvet covers to put on ourselves not good except they weren t duvet covers they were sheets two covers were subsequently requested and arrived given to us to put on ourselves except one was a double by this time it was about  am the receptionist was profusely apologetic and offered us complimentary breakfast at breakfast we asked for  coffee  teas and  fruit tea we got  coffee and two fruit teas when i pointed out the mistake we were brought  more tea at this point we gave up and my daughter and i shared the tea when we were leaving my daughter phoned reception and asked if they could book a taxi to take us to the station but when we arrived downstairs the receptionist said she d forgotten to do it not good we very nearly missed the train all in all it was quite tiresome 
 the rooms were small and very tired all needs refurbishment my initial room was so tiny and required going up a few stairs to get to the bed the quilt was too small for the bed and i could hear people talking asked to change rooms and was given a better room slightly larger which was appreciated have stayed in better hotels in london for less 
 very small bed small shower with a light very close above the showerhead toilet stuck around the side of the shower and a small room to boot also the fire alarm going off at    am just finished things off lovely 
 nothing could have been better
 the bathroom was small so if you are some over  foot just be aware there is not much room for you 
 the offers did not include breakfast you would rather buy a full package this was an unexpected surprise 
 the mattress was hard and you could feel the springs and the cornered handrail in the bath was impractical because you keep on catching your back on it
 bedroom very small cupboard in wrong place as left small floor space to bed english language a problem for some staff to understand 
 absolutely nothing negative to say 
 superior double for  couldn t swing a cat couldn t even get dressed without hitting the wall with an elbow quilt just reached edge to edge would have been a fight for two 
 i had a lower ground floor and you could hear the underground trains below not the only hotel to have this though 
 the bedroom was really cold and had single glazing apparently we could ve turned the radiators on using the air conditioning that wasn t explained to us and there was no welcome pack in the room our room was at the front of the hotel and i had a disturbed night s sleep from a lot of noise in the street also breakfast was so expensive we didn t choose it finally we chose the delux room supposed to be the bigger option but it was tiny the bedroom door couldn t even open fully 
 size of room was small even when i was upgraded rooms due to maintainence issues size of bathroom also very small hotel lobby very dark due to original dark wood walls requires more lighting 
 only thing was the room was a little small with no view a brick wall with a picture on it 
 we were charged too much when checking in and it took us a while before we received the refund back we never received a proper bill to explain what went wrong in the first place even after several times asking for a state of payment 
 what they call a superior double room is a box room i wouldn t recommend staying there if you want a couple of days also it seems when you arrive reception fill you with a sob story that  rooms are out of order so the booking has to be amended even though no prior warning is given via a courtesy call or email they recommend moving you to a sister hotel down the room we put up a bit of a fight saying we didnt want to move and wanted what we booked which ended up being a box room as we were walking away they seem to use this trick on another couple who arirved shortly after claiming there were no rooms for them seems to me they want you to book that specific hotel and when you arrive give you some sob story about the rooms being out of order how many other people have they tried this on it s value for money if you re not messed around 
 welcome at reception wasn t great room very small would like to know what the standard doubles are like however was ok for  nights bathtube needs bigger screen no mini fridge
 no opening window or view was probably the only downside but it was a cold few days and to be honest i was staying there while attending a conference so the view wasn t so important 
 the rooms are far too small for a couple i have asked to have a larger room and the staff accomodated me but the improvement was minimal in the new room 
 the only real issue for us was the mattress which could have been firmer for more comfort 
 room was upgraded to a basement room that wasn t much larger than bed i d hate to have seen my booked room later discovered that the original person who was to stay in that room complained and was given our room we were tripping over ourselves no room for our cases room smelled of smoke for over a day staff was very aloof hade to ask for the iron board and it didn t come the first day 
 i found x body hairs in my bathroom which were not mine this was really not good 
 small room for the money paid more was expected wouldn t recommend for this reason we were told on arrival that we were being given a free upgrade but i hate to think what our original booking was if this was considered an improvement 
 on arrival we were told we were upgraded to a club room which according to the receptionist was one of their largest rooms when we got to our room is was very small we had barely enough room to walk around the bed we had booked a superior room so i d hate to think how small this would have been having said that it was very clean and comfortable 
 room bathroom quite small which wasn t an issue as we didn t spend much time there floorboards were very creaky we could hear the guests upstairs moving around didn t really impact too much on our stay though 
 this weekend was booked for a gift for my father in laws th birthday i saaid this on the booking i was disapponted to know they had a    hour wait for the room and the room was like a box so the whole point of a special weekend was slightly over shadowed
 was upgraded to a club room but this was still minute couldn t walk around the bed paid more for a family room but extra space was not around the bed don t try to check in early staff had poor english 
 our ground floor room was very small 
 upon arrival we were shifted to a sister hotel because of boiler problems the hotels are rated four star but should be rated two star the tv had bad reception room service only left body cream and shower gel the first night the room was extremely small and closet space inadequate breakfast was fair with limited selection 
 room was absolutely tiny despite been told we had been upgraded to a club room the toilet was far too small especially the actual size of the shower the service in the bar and restaurant was beyond slow and food was bad 
 check in process was long could do with extra staff in busy periods to help out room was small but not much different in size to the standard london hotel room
 everything else poor wine in the evening cold room heating wasn t working on a sub zero february night no where to box and a box room you couldn t swing a cat in
 i hated the bathroom taking a shower was so hard the room was so tiny we couldn t fit despite it wasnt the smallest room staff was not very welcoming 
 size of the bed and room reception staff weren t very attentive while trying to check in she served  or  people while i was trying to pay 
 rooms were small but still everything you need was there didn t realise how much you could squeeze into the tiniest bathroom i have ever seen 
 the size of the room was a bit tight for  adults but yet sufficient for good rest 
 i don t approve of the staff removing plates from the table when the other person is still eating the british way is both plates are removed at the same time i found this made my experience of my meal very uncomfortable which is a shame because the food was lovely 
 i didht luke the rooms r very tiny and i didht like the reception girl martha which when i ask her to change room ahe lie to me and she told me is overbooked and dont have other room but when i speak with the manager suddenly she washt overbooked the hotel and i change room 
 rooms were awful hotel pulls you in with the nice looking lobby them boom your trapped in a small box that s barely of  quality also hotel cancelled first reservation so while i was half way to london i had to book another room wish i d booked a different hotel as that should have been a sign very disappointed
 the bathroom was not clean enough the windows were not well insulated so cold air kept creeping under them the bathroom smell was musky the ventilation was not working 
 nothing to add here 
 mould around window and window was dirty and also couldnt get in safe in wardrobe as the bed amd side cabinet was too close
 room was smaller than expected bathroom was very cramped in particular and shower was rubbish 
 on arrival the hotel room was not clean i was very disappointed also it did ruin my evening in saying that the way it was dealt with was brilliant i am extremely grateful for the night manager and some of the staff as they made it right as soon as they could 
 the room a deluxe double was just off the main staircase with a potentially injurious lack of space between the door to the room and the door to the staircase the window looked out on the acces ramp of an underground car park and service entrances to restaurants on queensway making it noisy and insalubrious deluxe is not a word i would have used 
 there was no space under the bed for my to hide and prank my girlfriend
 bedroom very small clean and comfortable with nice bathroom but small 
 i think this may be a london wide problem and i also have good hearing but i could hear the tube from my room on the ground floor throughout the night and morning the room could have been a bit cleaner i think the turn around is very busy there seemed to be a constant flow of guests which must put staff under pressure it lacked the finish i expect of a hotel and shows the difference between a  london hotel and  there was a slight mix up with our room but the manager and staff were more than accommodating to resolve this and went above and beyond to make it right and they improved my stay by doing so i would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely use again the next time i return to london any points i didn t like are simply little things 
 n a
 breakfast was overpriced for what you got and the room was very small 
 n a we didn t stay there long enough to notice anything we didn t like 
 rooms nice but small drinks expensive and overpriced
 the rooms were small however for the amount of time we spent there it really didnt matter location way more important beds were comfortable and it was spotlessly clean 
 we had problems with our pram and there was no lift available for us to the first floor so the stairs were a nightmare followed by more steps as you enter the tiny cramped bedroom not child friendly or suitable for disabled access 
 the double bed was something else the mattress was extremely hard we hardly slept at all the bedcover was very thin and not wide enough to cover two people we would not stay there again 
 the only thing that could have been better was the floor in the room was incredibly loud when we walked on it other than that we had a fantastic time 
 creaky floors but only to be expected given the age of the property 
 room was very small wardrobe was tiny no shower curtain meant bathroom floor got soaked every time the shower was on wallpaper was being applied to the corridors during our entire stay 
 room was tiny hardly enough space to walk round the bed on one side bedding and towels were tired not of the quality expected in a  hotel 
 unhappy with what was described as a luxury room no room to walk around bed amazed to see what you can squeeze into a small space we would hate to have been even slightly over weight 
 problems with holding deposits for hotel room we stayed in on second floor one side of corridor bit small for a couple staying smell of smoke in room 
 i think the walls and insulation are not too good as i could hear the guy in the next room hanging his clothes and snoring early in the morning 
 room quite small could nt make water empty from bath tiny bathroom 
 they had called me before i arrived to transfer me to another hotel because they have a maintenance work but i refused it took me  minutes to check in my room was deluxe but they upgrade it to club room which was so small the bathroom area was about   m by  m the sink was so small like a large soup plate and its was hard to adjust the tube to get warm water no phone signal at all because my room was in basement 
 well the staff were quite rude they got my information wrong and even told my girlfriend what i had ordered when it was meant to be a surprise food was cold morning and night and was interrupted twice by staff
 the staff at the reception was rude i had checked my account before leaving to go to the hotel and had seen that they had charged me according to the policy i had booked under the receptionist then informed me that this was not the case and that they were going to charge me again constantly telling me the first charge was a pre authorisation he was not willing to listen this was a frustrating and bad start to our stay the rooms are small which i was expecting due to it being in the centre of london but i did not appreciate the fact that the beds were not long enough going to the toilet was pretty much impossible there is no space at all they supply a kettle in the room but the tap in the bathroom is so small that you cannot fill the kettle there we had to use the showerhead not good 
 window didn t close properly and it was freezing at night mattress is awful duvet is really low quality duvet cover does not fit the duvet and linen do not fit the mattress noisy corridor room and bathroom are tiny staff are not very nice 
 arrival check in we were moved to a sister hotel due to a problem with the water heating and should stay there for the hole trip but insisted on going back room very small but ok for london
 the temperature of the room could have been more adjustable it was cold night and higher temp of the room would have been better
 when i turned up i was put in someone else s room then when complained they said the room i had booked was being refurbished was very disappointed then the room we ended up with was very poor window wouldn t stay open had to wedge open with a spoon single size quit on double bed 
 unfortunately painters working on our floor but were ever so polite initially my assigned room  had steps leading up to the bed area also toilet was tiny and didn t appear to be room i booked as had single wardrobe however staff quickly offered me another room 
 booking not honoured involuntarily transferred on arrival to associated hotel m away which while adequate lacked the character of the grand royale no prior consultation unacceptable 
 small rooms and bright lights from the smoke alarm fixtures that kept us up for most of the night if you need darkness to sleep request a room with a bed away from the smoke alarm 
 the reception staff were not sufficiently supervised and were inconsistent in resolving or responding to guests enquiries 
 bit difficult to get to by tube from kings cross and other london attractions like harrods covent garden etc requires at least one change of train room was basement level and bathroom was really small 
 we were lied to on arrival we were told that they tried to call us because the was maintenance taking place in some rooms that was untrue as had no missed calls really ruined our special weekend
 pillows a bit flat 
 the room is very small 
 the size of the rooms are tiny particularly the bathroom
 the room above me had a squeaky floorboard which woke me up during the night as the occupant was walking around but i did let the hotel know so hopefully it s been fixed 
 first room had a very noisy extractor fan outside it and i had to be moved this was done with no fuss and very quickly 
 i got a upgrade to a club room which is basically in the basement don t recommend getting that room it was really run down and just kinda filthy it says it was a non smoking hotel but i constantly smelled smoked in my room the shower was really small and the bed uncomfortable 
 i think the guy working in the bar th feb night around pm has some problem i ordered for the drink but he only served to other customers and i asked twice for the drink again he only said if you just sit down there i will bring up the drink and then i just left after  mins waiting and wasting since he has been serving other customers continually but not to me the bar was not even busy at all 
 there was a problem with the security system in bedroom  this caused some concern with the maintence team and my friend 
 when we arrived we were sent to another hotel because of some rooms being out of order we didn t like this since the other hotel was of a lower standard the room was tiny and the breakfast wasn t very good especially the coffee was bad just not what we booked but on the next day we went back to the grande royal to tell them of our dissatisfaction and they offered us an upgraded room and free breakfast for the rest of our stay we really appreciated this gesture thank you very much 
 bathroom was a bit tiny
 the corridors were too small and the floor was creaking which was annoying 
 the adminstration
 the room was too small and had steep steps inside the room the bed was small specially duvet was very small 
 decor was grubby in places our room  club room was a bit small limited beer selection in theatre bar checkout was very slow and the background music in reception was dreadful
 shower not great didn t complain though as didnt have time drain was clogged and the shower tray filled with water which was gross 
 the staff who booked us in was very unfriendly and the rooms are really tiny it s hard to even move in the room 
 bar shut   pm when you wanted to relax in nice surroundings and finish your evening off bar staff clearly told you it was shut pulled the shutter down and were very abrupt 
 hotel has low scruples phoned me hours before check in to say they wanted to move me to their paddington hotel due to hot water system being broken asked for discount and they told me they would ask another guest to move there was no problem with the hot water also superior double room was so small less than  between window and bed 
 the stairs in the room got old after the first night but we didnt want to move rooms we couldnt control the heat in the room and got uncomfortably hot each night
 rooms are a bit smaller than we expected but this was not so big deal 
 room on first night very small and very hot air con not working if i had known room so small i would of paid more for better room thankfully got upgraded to bigger room second night
 unorganised unprepared and disrespectful reception my room jey was always not working the shower leaked water the toilet seat uncomfortable very small and noisy room unnecessary stairs in the room the hall way was like a puzzle to get to your room very low security from reception at night the host who helped with the bag doesn t understand what tissue means 
 size of room and staff general unfriendliness
 when we arrived we had two singles pushed together rather than the double i had booked they remade the bed for us when we where out turning the bed into a kingsize as could be zipper together
 the size of the room for a double deluxe far to small bath had chips n rust shower went everywhere in the bathroom due to hardly any shower protection the staff who booked us in very unfriendly no smile or helpfulness 
 the price for one night plus breakfast was over  pounds the room was tiny too small room in the breakfast room the receptionists are not helpful and most of them are impolite 
 the shower in our room was to small
 there were a lot of stairs even getting into the front door a doorman would have been nice with my huge heavy suitcase 
 room was small 
 i booked a single room  and it was a bit small i will definately use the hotel again as am in london on average twice a month but will book a double room the price was competitive for a  night stay and hotel is a great standard 
 room very small and although the rooms are modern in comparison to the old building it was pretty scruffy in lots of places finish of carpet lots of marks on walls shabby blinds dirty doors etc and could really do with a refresh bathroom was modern but really tiny regularly stay in london but i wouldn t stay here again 
 the room size was adequate but the bathroom was too small and the shape made it difficult to use the very small sink and toilet 
 they need to change their preferred taxi service
 room a bit small but couldn t be helped 
 we had a room at the back of the hotel and vehicles kept reversing early in the morning so you would be woken by the beeping 
 nothing
 our room was very small the floorboards from the room above made a lot of noise which was annoying and made it hard to sleep the shower needed a curtain or glass wall our bathroom keep flooding from the water in the shower
 room was extremely small considering what we paid for the room myself and my partner kept bumping into each other when trying to walk around in the room due to limited space and layout 
 nothing
 rest room in the old room was very small to extinct u can t sit on the toilet
 rooms were very small but we knew this from previous reviews we looked at before booking however even the bathroom was very small and not much space to move around with two of us in there no iron or mini fridge in our room 
 rooms fine nothing grand about them the barman wasn t particularly friendly but that maybe down to his  hour shift 
 comfortable room but shower room a bit on the small side 
 the room was clean and comfortable however was a little tight for space makes me wonder how small our original room was 
 i wonder who gave the  to this upsolutely auwful  motel the room was like a cage and was on the lowest floor under the earth that made the walls of the room blowing cold air even if the ac was at  c it was freezing also the ac was loud extremely loud and above all the bathroom was with noooooo heating system winter in london  to  c are you serious its not only decieving but impertinent not even even if sbd payed me i would stay there i accept your apology so what thebasement rooms are still on sale and make sure nobody will get sick in the cellar i pin the view from the window of these  motel great view of garbage soooo nice enjoy it and good morning if you think you can make rooms out of your cellar and sell it for a a room in a  hotel like that forget it as i asked your personel in the night if they can change my room the answer was a no coz i booked this kind of room a deluxe in a a  sure not that was not a room that was where you put your garbage what is booking com do for this what is booking com do for this
 i am not sure i can grade the hotel i never actually stayed in it they called me and said the boiler had broken down and could i transfer to a different hotel but then see the days the builder broken down there were other guests in the hotel perhaps they were laid shifting 
 nothing
 the bathtub is too open then the bathroom was totally wet after shower 
 it wasn t an issue for me but there were some stairs down into the room as soon as you went through the door may not be suitable for those who have trouble with stairs so worth double checking when you book check in 
 a very small room but more than adequate for one nights stay on business 
 small room
 the room we were given did not look anything like the rooms on the website it was a tiny shoe box with modern decor however is was clean and newly furnished and had everything you d need 
 first room had no hot water they moved me but checked someone else in to the same room that person opened the door to my room and woke me up from my sleep about  mins a hotel employee came to ask me my name obviously they didn t have their communication down on the room switch also no restaurant open the bar food was terrible 
 the room we were initially given was ridiculously small superior double room more like closet however upon complaining to the staff they did give us a different room the next day 
 we arrived at   check in at pm and couldn t check in due to their system being down they offered us a free drink on the house when went to the bar there were another   ppl sipping their free drinks after having a very well needed glass of prosecco we changed at their wc and headed to town upon our return we were checked in in our deluxe room this room although was located on the first floor had its window near the ceiling it basically was a semi basement and we couldn t open windows either they were painted over so to get some fresh air we had to open the door otherwise the room was good shower is clean would stay there again but defo not on the st floor 
 the bathroom however luxurious gave off an unpleasant sewage smell it wasn t major but unpleasant anyhow the fridge in our particular room was very loud to the point where it woke us up in the night before being switched off the heating air con unit didn t seem to have any effect and needs upgrading 
 the view from my room  was told it was a bigger room but not told i would get a bad view where i couldn t see out 
 rooms are too small to the point of making a very uncomfortable stay the bar closes too early no space to have a drink or dinner even the bathrooms are so tiny 
 nothing
 the room was small and dirty the walls were dirty and the bed was made but the covers wernt changed on the second day even though they said they were changed but the same stain was in the same place on the bedding so it definitely was not changed the new towels were dirty so i had to go get them changed i wouldn t go back 
 room was quite small but if you re only sleeping there it s okay 
 rooms are a little small and in parts it does need some decorating renovation 
 little complications to reach some of the rooms after elevator door i needed to pass few corridors and steps up or down however the staff offered the help to carry the laguagge 
 the single room was too small i had a big suit case with me and i had absolutely no space to walk 
 bar staff and receptionists were very moody bordering on rude breakfast waitresses were however very friendly room size was farcical yes it was cheap but a x m room was certainly not advertised nor would it have been booked 
 rooms are pretty tiny if i was with a partner it would have been far too small cleaning was okay but sometimes things were missed bar was dead and no in room dining oh and tv s whilst large weren t hd
 rooms are very small and don t look anything like the pictures portrayed on booking com 
 shame about the room really basement twin barely a twin tiny tiny bathroom in which everything got wet quite noisy slightly shabby probably due a bit of a lick of paint and not that clean when we got in there sadly 
  wifi service is very poor and you have to log in every time  they mixed up our breakfast order twice  placed us in the basement despite my request to be in upper foors it was very noisy  the room service was very poor they were using the towels to clean the washroom floors and the bed sheets were not changed despite having stains on it  this is the first hotel i experience in my life that they don t have a scale to weigh our luggage
 while the room was moderately comfortable it was very small and lacked finesse the sheets didn t fit the bed the shower head did not appear to work properly and the bathroom door wouldn t close these were small inconveniences but for the cost of the room i would not have expected them 
 the hotel staff made a mistake on the date of my heathrow shuttle booking which did not arrive on my check out date it was only after i waited for mins and asked the hotel staff to call the shuttle company before they realized the mistake i had to make last minute alternative arrangements to heathrow airport and was nearly late for my flight 
 broken thermastat smell from drains told we would have a superior double room but it was standard apparently in this hotel superior means standard bedding inadequate no window no ventilation one sealed window that was dirty very small room 
 room was terribly small and the bathroom was even smaller i think this is typical for most european hotels i am from the u s and accustomed to larger facilities but it was very small for two people also we were in the basement meaning we had a terrible view and the one window we did have was drafty and leaked in wind all night long causing the person sleeping nearest the window to freeze 
 unfriendly and unhelpful staff they did not have any information on various questions such as parking in the neighbourhood or where to watch the new year fireworks they actually advised us to go trafalgar square where it was not screened and not possible to watch 
 bathroom was a little small and the rooms were plain compared to the lobby other than that it was good just thought they didn t keep in tone of the hotel 
 their room prices were a bit steep even that is fine but then it should include breakfast they didn t include the breakfast in the charge and it was  pounds per person which some might find expensive of one looks at the total amount spent 
 the size of room is really small although they upgraded us to a club room which was at lower ground and even through the window we could not see the sky or anything else except a wall and an air condition fixed on it 
 the cost of the smallest room we have ever had in london we asked at the end of the stay why our water was not replenished and was informed only the first day was included in the price unless you are a club member we believe that for in excess of  pounds for a  hour stay bottled water would be included the fruit was a nice touch but removed when left and not replaced it would of been nice to leave it for the following day the basis of this hotels prices seems to be the grand entrance as the remained of the hotel is a very dated 
 the shower didn t have a curtain strange design feature 
 asides breakfast no restaurant roomservice within the hotel so i have to make sure i eat before returning to the hotel or hold something to eat 
 the other receptionist at  inverness could do with training in customer service and interpersonal skills the rooms are a bit small but they are clean and tasteful
 the room was really small however we are in london and obviously the hotel cannot help this 
 nil
 the rooms are not as nice as the lobby no restaurant bar and even the lobby had no place to sit it s either sit in your tiny room or leave 
 the room was decidedly compact but in a good way
 the two steps stairs in my room it kind of annoying but it is okay bcz the whole hotel is awesome
 not all reception staff were friendly some did not even smile 
 nothing
 kettle and tv malfunctioned but staff dealt with the problems extremely quickly and efficiently
 the evening night staff was rude when i asked about the the double booking fee 
 i thought the room small and unimpressive for the upgraded room selected and below the standard i expect of  star hotels
 as many guests said the room is quite small and the shower could have a longer glass partition to avoid flooding the bathroom 
 during our stay the airconditioning was not funtioning property also there was no possibility to open any windows 
 small corridors and lifts smell of the mold
 heating had two choices a too hot b off too cold the staff knew this and did not tell me i woke three times during the night to turn on and off the heat when i told them they said they knew and if i called they would have given me a portable electric heater rooms are too small 
 stayed in club room very compact bathroom is very small however good power in shower and very clean 
 rooms very very small bed not very comfortable we were double charged for our rooms once we addressed this with staff they rectified and refunded us immediately
 did not like the stairs in the room which led to the bathroom and the room was very small good job we did not stay for any longer than  nights 
 the fact that we booked to stay in hyde park but got moved to paddington and was only told because we called to see if there were parking 
 the hotel looked much fancier on the photos than in reality the hallways were very narrow and claustrophobic the drain in the shower didnt work even after we warned the cleaning lady i got a discount meaning  pounds for two nights but this meant a room with a view of the opposite wall 
 no bad experiences our room was in need of a bit of tlc to bring it right up to standard but very clean and tidy
 price but i did book it last minute and we all like to save a bit of money
 we could not turn on the air conditioner they said since it s winter time they don t provide winter time well i think people should have the option room was too small blanket was too small for two people
 staff didn t offer any attraction discounts or airport pick up but when we did ask they were attentive
 overcharged room bill on check out charged for breakfast on the day before we arrived over charged on quoted price for breakfast command of spoken english from front of house staff difficult to understand room accessed via steps just inside door 
 hotel was selected because of the charming public lounge which turned out to be closed to guests because of a private party for the duration of our stay without access to the lounge the hotel was nothing out of the ordinary to justify its high price 
 we were on the ground floor at the rear of the hotel and our room looked over the rear of another building so no view as such but i expect the same can t be said for every room 
 the rooms were very small specially if you travel with a baby the price was the cheapest i found in the area i wanted to stay but it didn t not met my expectations
 room  was small and compact you could hear upstairs rooms and outside road breakfast was good but both mornings we went at   and the bacon and sausage was cold there were about  staff but they were not watching when people want serving half the time slow service for this priced hotel its a little out of main hubbs taxis expensive but tube station just around corner which is good i am not moaning senior management need to train staff to be more pro active watch the food so it doesn t go cold and smile 
 the breakfast was a dissapointment the food was wonderful but the service we found poor on asking for tea the used teapot was refilled dishes were not removed 
 i arrived with a baby and the hotel gave me a room downstairs at the ground floor to get there i have to climb up and down the steps and the room was too tiny and small too small 
 bit of confusion over final payment my son had to pay for his own gift i had already paid and had confirmation but same card was needed to check in and i was on holiday with no wifi 
 the room was quite small even after being upgraded 
 was in a twin club room it had very little space to move around in and had a tiny bathroom a squeeze but manageable however perfectly good as a place to sleep 
 i find the rooms very small and i m only   i couldn t make myself a hot drink as there was too much limescale floating around in the cup 
 not being able to stay there and being put in a sister hotel further up the road the room of which was very small we had looked forward to staying at the grand royale itself however as compensation they did give us complimentary breakfast at the grand royale throughout our stay 
 rooms are really small as often in london anyways way to hot in the room good breakfast but is not worthy the extra fee find room is not so easy
 such small room king size bed taking most of the space in the room the two of us could not move around at the same time and we are both small the large lounge room was always closed this was not as per the advertised facilities 
 the bedroom was tiny and not big enough to swing a cat we asked to change but the rooms we looked at were very similar in size
 size of bathroom far too small and as we were on a festive break the hotel had no festive feel with reception area no christmas spirit our bedroom had no outlook whatsoever 
 was on ground level inner courtyard couldn t get window to latch next morning one lift not working and the other one was being used for laundry
 i was moved on to another hotel further up the street on my first night having paid  per night no breakfast it was unpleasant i accepted free breakfast on my two morning stay they seemed sincere and apologetic bathroom in room  small and dated but ok considering it is a rustic full of character hotel 
 my arrival necessitated movement to a sister hotel due to a plumbing issue which was an inconvenience but well handled 
 room temp too warm for me breakfast choice v good but not quite hot enough but acceptable lack of parking
 even after insisting on a room change after the so called superior double transpired to be no more than a shoe box we were allocated a club room in the basement with a view of a wall no daylight the room was cramped and small and the bathroom was no bigger than a toilet cubicle with a tiny shower enclosure even the sink in the bathroom was so tiny that you could not have used it to wash in 
 i m not usually one to write reviews but i am that unhappy and feel i need to warn people about how awful it is upon arrival the foyer was impressive it s a very beautiful building with art on the ceilings but unfortunately the rooms were a very different story the duvet cover had a big yellow stain on it so we had to ask for a clean one but when we tried to call down to reception the buttons on the phone had been pushed in so we couldn t use it and we didn t even get an apology there were dirty marks all up the walls and curtains we ordered an english breakfast with tea but the tea never arrived the gap between the wall and one side of the bed was about ft so no space to move our view was of other rooms at   we were packing to leave when a member of staff just barged in despite check out being at  not happy at all with this hotel especially as we paid a lot of money we would not stay here again 
 reception staff on arrival allocated us a room which was already occupied bathroom very small i m not sure why this room was a superior double 
 really small rooms and bathroom breakfast is expensive and not worth it the coffee pace around the corner had better and cheaper breakfast staff was unfriendly at check in but became better during our stay 
 on arrival we were advised without any apology that we would be moving hotels because they had booking issues we planned our trip around staying in that location and specifically wanted a traditional hotel not a modern one with dirty restaurant that we got moved to my wife was was pregnant and we did not want to be shuttled around hotels on what was meant to be a special weekend away we have not received a word of apology from the hotel after our visit 
 on arrival we were advised the hotel staff had organised alternative accommodation due to a plumbing issue with our room our alternative accommodation did not have a double room they only a twin room available 
 horrific i stay in london every week in  or  star hotels this isn t a  star in my opinion dirty dated and grubby shame for such a beautiful building 
 the room was tiny and shabby marks on the walls and dated decor very dusty also water not replaced for second night of stay very expensive with breakfast not even included internet kept dropping constantly with need to keep entering password 
 there was an offer by the hotel on booking com when i chose it and set my dates it confirmed to me a totally different date thinking i was wrong i repeated the process but again the same result so i ended up paying for two nights at the same unwanted date i called the hotel but they told me that i have to call booking com i called booking com but they told me i have to call the hotel what a trap 
 the double room was incredibly small so would upgrade to club next time lack of choice for room service 
 room too small we booked superior room and got noisy club room next to lift  smallest room i have ever stayed in quite clostraphobic the advert said we were getting  discount did complain but to no avail there to felt i had been hoodwinked john stokes
 woken up by banging and drilling from work being done next door when the lady came to clean our room she left a big bag of rubbish in our room that wasn t ours on the morning of check out house keeping wanted to clean our room at  am check out not till noon 
 the lifts were out of order at times the staff were pleasant but did not appear friendly
 very few staff members spoke english as their first language which made expressing our needs very difficult the night manager was argumentative rude and unhelpful 
 our room was tiny the bathroom door opened into our bed it was that small we could hear everything from the room above television talking and banging didn t sleep at all it was for our th wedding anniversary so very disappointed 
 the shower could of done with a bigger shower screen to prevent the bathroom floor getting drenched
 that we had to change to another hotel and it was a lot less luxurious then the hotel that i chose and paid for the room was extremely small and there was nothing in our mini bar the breakfast was not good 
 room bathroom were extremely small only a very small  door wardrobe no shower screen or curtain in the bathroom the whole bathroom will be wet during shower there were no space to put your luggages not to mention to move around in the room 
 room extremely small no bathrobe provided although on request 
 smell of drains was overwhelming at times i would hope it was unique to my room and not a common theme 
 lift only to floor  and the a flight of stairs to floor  where the room was located no view from room
 i paid extra for the breakfast couldn t get in to eat dinning room full couldn t accommodate a table for  wanted us to sit  at one table  at another
 rooms little small if you open your suitcase you will have to step over it to get to door or bathroom 
 sadly for the price it costs its just not worth the money the deluxe room is tiny and this was an upgrade dread to think what we would have got if we hadn t not clean enough and looking tired which you wouldn t expect from somewhere of this price range and star 
 very small room with no space at all so it is hard to move the room we stayed in had a very small window at the top which you could not even open so the room itself was a bit dark and stuffy it felt a like living in a basement furthermore you can hear everything through the walls for example when guests in a room above you wake up you can hear their steps if your breakfast is not included in a room rate make sure you pro actively ask the reception for a cheaper pre booked option when checking in otherwise you are not informed pay more for the same when just coming for a breakfast in the morning and may have unpleasant surprise when checking out and discovering it at that moment nothing can be done as it is in the system already 
 room to small for a double it did not feel like a deluxe room difficult to communicate with some of the staff
 nothing
 the bedroom did not match the description on the website it was tiny and the bathroom was so small it was actually difficult to move in there we also paid extra for a club room but this just seemed to mean a bowl of fruit and a small bottle of wine were left in the room it was not the luxurious pampering advertised 
 very noisy outside in the night and early morning our room was at the back of the hotel and there were workmen outside early on saturday and sunday morning from  am
 everything
 the mixed gender toilets within the hotel were very cramped upon arrival other than that i could not fault the hotel 
 windows couls not be opened the double bed a bit on the small side 
 very small room the room was so cold central heating doesn t work from am pm hotel policy they did get me a heater though felt that towels and linen weren t so clean 
 small rooms small bathrooms smashed bugs on the walls holes in the wall whole above window stuffed with paper towels poor housekeeping 
 the rooms on the ground floor are very cold because of huge old windows the noice isolation is very bad very noisy the rooms are very small 
 rooms are very small related to the amount paid it is too expensive comparing with  stars hotels i paid over  pound night that a very high cost for this tiny room food and beverage are expensive they offer me to pay  pound for breakfast and i didn t not get it of course i am not in four seasons hotel so it is my only complain that the cost is too high related to what i get room size and food 
 the adequacy of the room size appears to be pot luck the room i was in for the second period of my stay was much better than the first see my other review following the first period of my stay 
 all the little stairs before you get to the room the shower door was very small no room to put your toiletries no room to hang the towel by the basin the walls were too thin i could hear my neighbor snoring the room service was only cold sandwiches 
 had only one night would have liked to try the bar but it closed early didn t have breakfast included in room rate that 
 the room we stayed in was a bit small and the  steps up into it were a bit unexpected the shower could do with a bit bigger shower screen curtain as the loo and floor got soaked while in it 
 rooms were to small 
 the temperature of the room and no air con the bathroom was very small with a sliding door and was very close to the first bed the shower would drench the whole bathroom floor 
 unfortunately there is nothing grand or royal about this hotel i had room  the floor creaked the ceiling creaked as people in the room above me moved around the room was not clean old grubby fingermarks on both sides of the bathroom door weeks of dirt on the washbasin lamps corners of the bathroom hadn t been cleaned housekeeping woke me up and walked in at  am then back again at  am even though checkout is specified as   noon i had an upgraded room to superior and it was tiny cms between the bed and the wall window god knows how small a standard deluxe room is 
 not royal not grand the rooms are very small like prison cell not enough space for luggage maintenance very bad 
 arriving after a  hs flight and being told my room was sold to sb else and no longer available even having my credit card as a guarantee after  minutes i got another room for extra price after complainig some more the extra charges were removed from my bill but this procedure is unacceptable front desk and reservation department needs plenty of training in good manners and hotel service 
 dreadfully noisy woken up very early sunday morning by people servicing building adjacent don t stay on this side of hotel
 the superior room wasn t it was adequate but compact lack of restaurant 
 when i booked the room through booking com i thought i was going to have the superior room on arrival i was given the club room box the shower was so tight i was not able to turn round it was that tight the wardrobe was in the worst place by the door which was not helpful on entering the room i thought the cost of the room was expensive as it was not the room i had booked with booking com
 the staff who dealt with the initial arrival and stringent way they dealt with the hotel policy when they had no authority for specific information the misinformation the staff gave in relation to credit card provider and details of the credit card being passed to their finance dept when not authorised 
 the room was really quite small but for  per night from wowcher it was worth it considering the location there was quite a bit of noise in the early hours as the room was at the back of the hotel and backed onto shops getting they re deliveries etc and the air con heating didn t work properly flashed on the wall until i covered it with a towel also the sink plug wouldn t close for my partner to have a shave in there was no view as the window was frosted we didn t eat in hotel maybe next time
 room just too small particularly if you have any luggage and who doesn t 
 the bathrooms were a tad small i had a bathtub my friend had a shower and the one with the shower was tiny breakfast was good but expensive 
 do not stay here i had a single room i didn t mind the small size of it however the bedroom ac only sent out hot air even though it was set at  degrees the plumbing in the bathroom made noise all night and there was a green light in the hallway ceiling that was too bright and lit up the room at night a really uncomfortable experience i got about  hours sleep 
 rooms were small we had a club room which had only a double bed with very little space around it there was a curious little area by the windows with a desk which had no heating though you could close it off with a curtain bathroom was very small with a tiny washbasin and shower no bath 
 i thought the size of the room on arrival to be small disappointing misleading at time of booking the room didn t smell very clean i asked to be moved 
 against the positives the hotel has some clear minuses starting from the size of the rooms we had booked a double deluxe room and we found ourselves in a ridiculously minuscule room where two people can hardly move at the same time and the bathroom was at best sq m as a side note one of the two lifts has been permanently out of service which made the waiting time to go up and down unbearably long a final warning for future possible customers some of the rooms the hotel offers are in the basement if you are unlucky enough to be assigned one of those rooms when checking in watch out you don t want to be there 
 did not have a bad experience at all the only recommendation would be to have a larger shower 
 staff very noisy in the morning cleaning a room opposite when we were sleeping well trying to 
 the room was ridiculously hot even with the air con on  degrees and the fan on full the pillows are very uncomfortable the room looks clean until you look at the skirting s or ledges 
 parking was advertised to me that indicates parking on hand and easy and part of the hotel property under their control was only parking on street or at very expensive private car park found space after  minutes
 room was as big as a shoe there wasn t even enough room to open the little foldable rack that you lay your suitcase on although there was one in the room
 the rooms were incredibly small it was difficult for two people to sleep on a double bed we literally had to hop around the room there isn t even any space to open your bag i know rooms in london and specially in zone  are small i have lived in other hotels in central london as well but the room here were a big disappointment 
 the room was to small one could not pass between the bed and the window on one of my  day stay the room and bath have not been cleaned we found it in the evening as we had left it in the morning 
 lobby is crowded and needs to be cleaned plus they need to put clocks in the room
 bar shuts early no ironing service rooms are tiny so so small we had a club room supposedly bigger you couldn t open the wardrobe and exit the room or enter the bathroom over space then bathroom my guess m
 the fruit was a nice add to but should have been checked before we went into the room because the banana left was rancid 
 sheeets had spots it was all very dusty and the room was very tiny the girl at the reception was really rude the room was not serviced in the morning and when i returned to the hotel at  pm i found it as i had left in the morning 
 the only little complaint i have is you need to clean the bathroom doors more often mine was sticky the rest of the room was very clean though 
 we were given two single beds pushed together rather than the double that we thought we had booked the room was a bit of a dungeon might suit some but for this couple it was not a happy outcome to a romantic evening 
 despite booking this hotel in january we were given rooms at top of hotel classed as superior rooms they were more like attic rooms you could not walk around the small double bed however we were given complimentary breakfast 
 bar closes too early in the evenings bar decor was a bit shabby and tired single room although comfortable i felt in an exposed and remote situation at the back of the hotel the double lock on the door did not work and the safety chain could easily be broken if door forced 
 the noise on top our room was below the conference and they did not move us when they had an event they were moving the furnitures and fixing the mir conference room till am and we had hardly any sleep we kept on complaining but they only stopped early morning and started early 
 bedroom was very small and cramped with one side of double bed against a wall and not much space on other side for anything other than walking to bathroom small desk at base of bed but not enough space to sit at the desk i was traveling alone so just needed somewhere to sleep 
 the room was really small and there are lots of stairs even within the room
 we were given a room that was as the last person left it ie towels everywhere and used bed etc etc reception apologised and moved us immediately 
 the shower is very small and my wakeup call was  minutes late my day of departure 
 certain staff were not knowledgeable and did not provide reliable assistance 
 hotel took extra payment from credit card which wasn t refunded until arrival despite phone calls breakfast not included in price very unusual these days english fluency not brilliant 
 small room but it is london 
 the staff is not polite and cannot even take the pain of answering to a good morning the rooms are ridiculously small and dirty the bathroom is simply a joke m this hotel is not worth even  star
 we arrived at royale hotel at hyde park where they took my payment for the room it was only after they took my payment that they then told us that there was maintenance issues within the building so they would have to re locate us to another hotel in paddington they paid for our taxi but told us the taxi would be with us in  mins however we were made to wait  mins before i had to again ask the staff how long it would be the hotel itself was really nice just the whole point of us having to be re located after i had already made payment was not acceptable 
 our room was nice but was a little cramped trying to walk around the bed the tv didn t have good reception 
 i had a ground floor room the view was of a brick wall and at times you could hear the tube arriving departing although it didnt disturb my sleep the rooms are very small 
 upon arrival there was one person at the desk who was on the phone which is understandable however after  minutes of not even any eye contact as acknowledgment and a mobile phone ringing constantly behind the desk as it was not switched on silent we were then greeted she told us our room was not ready so we could have a club room in the basement if we liked we did appreciate the upgrade from a double room but we still found it to be quite small when entering the room i immediately noticed the black marks all over the walls my partner then noticed a huge crack in the toilet seat i turned on the air con and dust visibly flew out so i ran my fingers over it and found that it indeed was covered in dust after informing the front desk and upon return to our room i was pleased to see the toilet seat was replaced and air con cleaned i decided to have a bath and noticed the plug was broken so in order to drain the water after my bath i had to annoyingly fiddle with it then when flushing the toilet the actual button stuck and constantly flushed until i forced it to pull back out on my first night i had ordered and orange juice and glass of prosecco my orange juice which was visibly not being used anymore due to the water floating on top of it and the orange juice sunken to the bottom was left and was still there when we were checking out i proceeded to write my comments in the leaflet provided after i finished writing i turned to the back of the leaflet and to top it off it was covered in some sort of sticky substance which just added to my frustration we looked at a range of hotels and chose yours as it is truly beautiful from the outside and seemed like somewhere we could enjoy staying at however we didn t even want to drink in the bar or relax in our room because we were that disappointed my partner was extremely unhappy too as this getaway was a gift for me overall unfortunately this was not an enjoyable experience from start to finish 
 i know it was in a deal but the room was very small it was at the end of the top floor corridor in the eaves 
 do not order room service we ordered two panini s in the evening one cheese chicken and the other cheese pepperoni this was to come with a side salad and crisps this was a simple choice and we expected nothing fancy however when the dish arrived the panini was soggy and had also somehow been strewn over the plate the bottom of the panini stayed on one side the filling on the plate and the top of the panini had been squashed on the other side it looked as though a child had been playing with our food before it even arrived i took the food down to show the manager only to be told that that is how a panini should look i said i have eaten many panini s over the time and this is not how a panini should look the chef came and said oh i dont know how a panini should look i dont eat them this wasnt really the response i was hoping for so just to make you aware please dont order the room service you will be disappointed 
 room was a bit small and breakfast was a little pricey but still within comfortable standards 
 clean modern bathroom but very cramped
 we were moved from grand royale to shaftesbury international up the road i agreed because i was told the replacement was the same standard it wasn t we were upgraded to a club room which was tiny hair on floor in bathroom and hair in towels specks of dirt in bed some sort of ironing residue the hotel was next door to some sort of hostel with a rowdy group of drinking buddies outside 
 maybe i haven t got my head around london pricing yet but i couldn t understand why a glass of red wine and a bacardi coke in the theater bar should cost considerably more than a breakfast we did get better value in bars located nearer the hotel 
 deluxe double room is grossly misrepresented in the hotel s online advertising over a nine day stay my room was never cleaned properly and if luckily the bedding which was old and worn may have been changed  time on several occasions i saw the front desk staff engage in quite unpleasant discussions with guests who arrived to find that their booking had to been honoured or those like myself who were very unhappy with the accommodation i was promised an upgrade to a club room after  night but the front desk never followed up on this 
 nothing negative to say but if i was forced to give something it would be that the pillows are hard and uncomfortable 
 the room size is terrible small for us from asia to london cant stay in this hotel because we cant even open one luggage no space to walk around and even place your products or hang your clothes the room is even smaller than japan room i think winter period not advise for long haul flight to stay here do not have the space to place or even pack thing we need to hop around dam funny for us we are consider petite sizes and we need to hop around the room hahaha good work out for us this hotel is good for  days  nites short stay with one small bag 
 one small thing that could be improved is the glass shower screen on the bath shower was not big enough 
 difficult to get around the bed duvet too small lovely view of the bins from neighbouring shops
 decor is dreadfully bland and whole place feels soul less the reception and bar are particularly small and totally lacking in comfort not even enough chairs it is a beautiful old building but has been badly modernised and in no way is this a four star hotel apart from the great staff 
 a little expensive for the average traveller we were last minute booking or would have chosen elsewhere in the area they tried to bill us for breakfast we didn t have and very disorganized on check out 
 room was substandard for price and did not have fore poster bed nor queen size beds as per advert and confirmed by reception breakfast was wrong on both mornings bar closed at am no dining in the evening
 we were in room  very noisy from am doors banging constantly we could constantly hear the bleeping of a key pad followed by another door banging we had asked for a quiet room also a small point re the wardrobe hanging space not long enough for clothes perhaps one shelf should be taken out 
 pricing of a single person  x m room adjacent small shower was unreasonable i don t know how the picture of the bed was made it must have been made before they built the walls around the room could not have been more than  cm between bed and wall on one side only had to stack furniture on the cabinet to have access to bed from bathroom unpractical cabinet to stow luggage while there was no room to leave it in the room 
 i booked a double room for  person but when i reached on that day they gave us  single room due to some maintenance problem of them yet still changed us to other property with double room 
 every thing expansive room is dark no refrigerator the bathroom door is very old and locked us inside many times my mistake is i paid for my whole stay in advance 
 the room was very warm and we had to prop a window open to get fresh air the mattress was probably past its use by date the shower screen was not wide enough for us to stop water going onto the floor 
 nothing
 as with many big cities rooms and bathrooms are quite small even in the club rooms 
 the room was too small with very cerky floor poor sound proof low ceiling and very dirty window
 room was a bit claustrophobic often seen in older uk properties would appreciate a second chair so that both residents could sit simultaneously 
 not quite walking distance to paddington room was small and oddly configured with about  stairs from the door to the room breakfast was expensive coffee better around the corner 
 the room was tiny i have never stayed in a room so small ever the quilt was not big enough to cover both of us the bathroom is tiny and down a set of stairs no where to put anything because the room is so small 
 although we were advised we had received an upgrade on our room our room was tiny felt very claustrophobic especially in the bathroom e g very tight squeeze getting out of the shower hit my knee on the sink the first day net curtains were dirty window broken and had a horrible view of a dirty alley from our window if this was the upgrade i dread to think what our original room would have been like for a  star hotel and the amount we paid i would not have expected any of these things 
 we had to climb a narrow staircase and walk along very narrow corridors to our room the room was too small for its description as a superior double if we had not benefited from a big room rate discount we should have been very dissatisfied 
 the rooms are a bit worn down and showing their age for the price and location its still a good deal 
 bed very uncomfortable on last night for some strange reason fine for rest of stay spoilt the overall impression 
 the staff is friendly but not well organised they kept us waiting in front of them in the lobby for almost  hours for our room over the announced checkin time 
 simple things the duvet was far too small for the bed the coffee and sugar were not replenished when asked when having a shower the screen was so small that water went all over the floor 
 room very very small i booked a double and it felt claustrophobic for  glad there wasnt  of us no restaurant and room service menu limited room needed redecorating and as an older female i would have appreciated a little help with my luggage up and down front steps no porter and reception ignored me i am a regular visitor to london and usually stay   star and i just feel grand royal could do better
 the room was very small and was quite stifling with no opening windows or room air conditioning ok for  night
 i choose a club room which i paid a little more for however although it had everything you would expect it was quite small with a window only  foot wide 
 nothing really room was really small but had everything required so we would stay there again 
 we didn t try breakfast at the hotel as  seemed far too expensive 
 everything the rooms are small and cramped the staff are just there not welcoming or even happy looking they freeze money in your account you at the bill on arrival and the don t free i your monet until about three days after your stay disgusting
 we requested them to change to a suite on day one since rooms were very small and they did not give us one 
 the only thing we didn t like is one of the managers on duty during the day showed very little concern for the customer awful to have to deal with fortunately the rest of the staff made up for him 
 the checking in and checking out processes are very slow with staff not taking any notice of people arriving serving people in the wrong order is just annoying first come first served should be respected not enough of a problem to be negative but be prepared to be assertive 
 room was tiny like a renovated closet yet everything was there as it was obviously well planned out 
 room could be bigger but i can t complain given its ideal location in london 
 that rhe hotel did not have a dinner service or any out of hours room service if you felt hungry this is poor as where the hotel is based you can not buy any food after pm
 the room was very small although we got upgraded into a bigger room but still it was small the cleanses was poor 
 rooms were small but this is reflected in the price so not bad value for money public areas were nice 
 room was quit small check in was slow and complicated some lack of information and misunderstanding of booking and payment difficult to catch with email 
 nothing
 small room ground floor front room closed for a private party almost each night but the bar in the back room was open 
 extremely small rooms had a club room which was very small staff were wonderful and put me in s different club room with more space and a better view surprised that it is a  star hotel
 tiny room have constantly to sign into wifi staff was rude in the beginning but became nicer and the sheets were not changed on our second day 
 rooms too small hardly any space to put your luggage especially if you take a single room
 arrived to find there were boiler problems they tried to palm us off with another hotel which was inferior and had a walk up price  cheaper than what i had paid we have experienced this excuse multiple times in london so stood our ground another room was conveniently found for us after not accepting their offer 
 nothing really 
 rooms are tiny
 my reservation was for two bed it was not available when we checked in it became available  days later your front desk did a fantastic job that we decided to stay and i am glad we did 
 lack of variety on the room service menu problems with key cards 
 staff did not acknowledge you when coming and going rooms very small cannot move around furniture bathroom was the size of a closet 
 my room was really small and had a large twin sized bed didn t really have a restaurant breakfast only but that wasn t a problem as i found restaurants in the area to eat in 
 the room is not practical difficult to open the window stairs after the door to get in the room loss of space no cover on the bath so the water gets all around the bathroom hairdryer attached to drawer but not enough space to sit down on the chair am i supposed to steel the hairdryer there were small flies
 i would have liked breakfast to have been included in our stay we were offered it at a reduced rate but it would have been easier if it was included in the initial price as an option 
 fire alarm kept going off plugs did not work one morning and staff did not know the jogging route mentioned in the hotel guest guide rooms not serviced promptly and at our convenience
 upon arrival we had to wait  minutes in the rain before someone could help us bring our  suitcases up the stairs into the reception area we had booked and paid for two of the same rooms as we were a group of  people one of our rooms were a downgrade from the other the rooms did not have the same appliances and one room had less space than the other we asked to be moved so we could both have the same room type and they said yes but never got round to it we had to wait over an hour for some ice buckets we found a thick long transparent plastic string in one of plates of breakfast and the restaurant staff actually looked into my hair and told me it was my hair because nobody in the kitchen has that hair we accidentally dropped salmon on our bed sheets and it smelt really bad so we asked if we could have a new duvet they gave us an uncovered single duvet for our double bed so when we asked for a double the night porter gave us the same dirty salmon duvet that we had put on the floor outside the room when we confronted him about it he shouted you cannot expect us to clean the bedding everyday my card was overcharged by  when i had checked out when i rang the hotel to let them know they said it s not their fault it s my bank when i called my bank they had given me  preauth codes proving the hotel were holding an extra  from my card and they had to fax my bank to allow the to cancel it the manager was unable to use his own fax machine so he sent me the fax letter through email and he made it my duty to get it faxed to a bank they are highly unprofessional and i will never ever stay at this hotel again it is appauling and disgusting 
 size of the club room we were in very small luckily we travelled light 
 very small room quite a challenge with two suitcases 
 lots of ladies entering the hotel at random hours of the night and visiting various rooms i guess they must have been looking for something they lost 
 very small and by the way they gave me a club room i cannot imagine the sizes of the other rooms not very clean no room service wifi is zaft always disconnect expensive the view of room is horrible
 am smoke alarm causing everyone to attend the main foyer for an hour on thursday    also relatively small rooms and dining room staunch ions need removal 
 cleanliness of rooms is challenging there was a bit of misunderstanding regarding on room upgrade but they managed it quickly 
 i loved every moment well done thank you for a wonderful weekend ioannis batsos
 reception staff poor upon arrival  staff behind reception seemingly dealing with  unhappy guest whilst we stood there finally someone came to check us in he demanded full payment straight away which is fine then told us our room was not ready this was pm check in is pm not a good start 
 the rooms are very small i booked a deluxe double room which is supposed to be bigger than a superior double room but it is difficult to imagine a room smaller than the one i had there was not enough space to get out of one side of the double bed the fire alarm went off at am not the hotel s fault but the following night i was kept awake by faulty door chimes which i couldn t stop from flashing green and red it was like trying to sleep in a night club 
 the wifi kept clicking off and there was only one shower gel but over all amazing
 the fire alarm went off at am it was chaos no one knew what to do proper legal protocol was not followed poor communication from the staff and not one word of an apology until we brought it up the next morning it spoilt out overnight stay the hotel could be fabulous just staff and decor in some rooms let it down 
 my room was smelly and small hence beds are small for couples no space in the room to store my luggage the lady in the reception showed me other rooms which still small and we have to pay extra money for no value 
 room was extremely small despite being located on the first floor you feel like in the basement small unopenable window half bricked up you have to climb up the stairs to the bed the bathroom you cannot turn around poor working wifi 
 moved to another hotel at the eleventh hour situated on the ground floor of an annex next to the front door and lift i booked above ground had to cross a road to go to breakfast 
 room was small and the small window did not make the room very light 
 no facecloths a must for me bath was too high to comfortably access shower for someone my age  no dining room music a bit dismal
 we didn t have a bad experience
 the room was on the small side and the electronic maid service alarm kept buzzing in the night and at times in the morning 
 windows didn t open we had to wait for our room although were offered a room on the lower ground floor instead
 i have updated my room to luxury room on booking website but i didn t got it and the breakfast was included and also they said you have to pay another   each for breakfast that s not fair i got the deal on booking com and when you arrive giving you different things and different deal
 the size of the room was very or should i say extremely small hardly can move or have place to keep our laguge 
 although there is a main elevator climbing up and down side stairs a bother with bags 
 bathroom could have been a little larger showerscreen far too small 
 deluxe double was a very small room could barely walk around the bed the ceilings were also low on th floor so when i was in shower i nearly hit my head on ceiling and i m only  foot  there were no special out of ordinary touches eg refrigeration guest robes iron or board in room there was a kettle and blow dryer it was clean however i would rate this a  star
 read my comment above
 unable to take a shower without soaking the tiny bathroom 
 bar closes early for a saturday room was very small and although it was on st floor wasn t possible to open window maids are very noisy in the morning
 our room was hidden away in the basement but then it was one of the cheaper rooms 
 the st night was terrible we were arranged to a single room in the basement where our luggages couldn t be opened because of the limited spaces when we opened our room you need to walk up the stairs really terrible but we paid over  dollars hong kong very unhappy and disappointed we complained and the manager upgraded us to club room which was acceptable for the rest of my stay 
 at first a staff gave me a room on first floor that i had to walk up many stairs and through a long corridor with my big heavy luggage luckily another lady arranged a room on ground floor for me that made me feel more comfortable 
 duvet too small for comfort told we could request for down pillows n bedding never came bed softer than most other places we ve stayed in london bed n bedding duvet pillows poor sub standard quality does not match to your hotel image quite disappointing bedroom though small is expected but configuration awkward opens bathroom door to block access to basin tight n squeezy even for one really need to look into that 
 rooms was very compact and didn t look four star which was a shame as the hotel itself was gorgeous and staff fantastic
 the room was just far too small to justify the price tag not enough room for one let alone two suitcases the bathroom was more like a broom closet 
 no open windows open door to accommodation to be greeted by five steps also does not overlook hyde park as advertised
 the rooms are little small but i think for the money i paid i got the best value good job grand royal hotel 
 on check in we was told we had to be relocated due to a maintenance issue the chap who dealt with this didn t do so in the best manner what upset us the most was the hotel option was not as good and cheaper than yours and when i said we will cancel and i would book elsewhere myself we was allowed to stay this ruined our start to our stay marks on all bedroom walls and a toe nail clipping on bedroom carpet small bedroom also 
 very small rooms just fit a double bed with small staircase to the bathroom which was tiny i guess its because of the location which was excellent
 for the third time i was bumped out of the hotel upon arrival to another in the group the other hotel had a lift out of order the tv worked when the porter shook it and a large bathroom towel hook fell off the wall on my foot i am fed up with not being able to stay at the hotel i booked and i am meant to be on their partner frequent stay list what was worse while waiting for a taxi to go to other hotel they were booking other solo travellers in 
 despite being upgraded to club the room was tiny and the window opened to the staff entrance which was noisy and busy with people smoking i asked to email the manager but no email was sent to me with his contact details 
 small rooms and expensive as far as quality and price is concerned
 the bedroom was small in spite of being told we were getting an upgrade it makes me wonder what the downgrade was like the bed itself was uncomfortable
 towels were rough 
 the initial room we had was very small and we had to upgrade to a bigger one the mattress felt as if it was very old as it was extremely soft and the springs felt broken 
 the room was tiny just enough space to walk around the bed there was a computer that guest could use but the printer s cartridge was depleted and it was not changed after a request to do so 
 however the rooms were compact and we were asked on arrival if we wanted to upgrade for free to a club room which was bigger than the room we had booked the club room turned out to be compact and the bath was tiny no view as it was on the lower ground floor wouldn t stay here again 
 we were transferred to a sister hotel as the boiler wasn t working the alternate hotel is advertised as  star i don t think this rating was gained via the normal national rating system as it doesn t come close to other  star rated hotels i have stayed in it does not meet the high standard expected of a  star the bedroom was small and cramped the room smelt and the bathroom was worn tattered unclean and the breakfast was average it was a real disappointment 
 the rooms were a little on the small side but adequate can t say anything negative as it has great location clean rooms and friendly and helpful staff 
 room was a little small for u s standards but i was expecting it to be much smaller based on previous reviews very comfortable size for a european hotel pillows were a little hard and creeking floors from guests in room above were at times annoying but very minor no shower curtain but that s a european thing 
 paid the supplement for the larger deluxe room but still very compact in size

 room was small no place in bathroom to plug in a hair dryer wi fi not very reliable 
 very small room overpriced bed extremely uncomfortable nobody asked if i was fine or if i enjoyed my stay 
 the room was really tiny the bathroom even more 
 rooms are very small you cannot unpack your bags 
 nothing that i can think of 
 nothing
 room size was so small we could not put any luggage on the floor which means completely unpacking and storing it or putting it under the bed the sitting area was really too small to eat at when we ordered room service would have liked a view of the park as it was just a sliver twice the hot water disappeared in the middle of a shower and twice someone was walking on the roof early in the am which woke us up we made our complaints know so hopefully resolved for next guest 
 beds are very high in case you are travelling with very small children and they fall off the bed other than that the hotel and staff were excellent 
 not worthwhile noting negatives
 i didn t like that we only stayed for one night 
 nil
 at  pm our room not ready and the check in was too late around  pm and early check out   pm maximum it s too small in space and the break fast by order menu not an open buffet massage room not prepared for that purpose and it s not too close to shopping center need a taxi 
 pool area could do with some tlc sauna was good though 
 bed a little firm but that s a personal choice and not a reflection on the quality and supberb facilities 
 room is very very small especially the bathroom hard to walk or eat in the room when you have luggages 
 that we had to leave 
 cannot think of anything other than the pool was a bit small but it is central london so a pool was a bonus for our boys 
 bit expensive 
 too much knocking on my door in order to be at service sometimes less is the best 
 some of the upholstery in the lounge needed replacing 
 nothing although the room is small however worth it in their services and location 
 expensive extras valet laundry etc and room service taking cleaning things that were not always required to be taken cleaned
 leaving i loved my stay there 
 use of lounge for afternoon tea service tends to put you off using lounge for relaxation as all places are laid for tea service one can still use lounge but i felt i was intruding in some way 
 the lounge is used as a venue for afternoon tea so cannot be used just to relax and read etc one can use the bar or conservatory but these are not as comfortable as lounge 
 room far too small
 price too high for facilities and room size low ceiling due to the stairs at the entrance of the room limited options for an english breakfast besides the  types of meals which i skipped for a scrambled egg option no other foods were available expected more fruits and drinks 
 no tea and coffee making facilities in the room
 nothing at all 
 the check out procedure payment operation 
 a little chilly in the restaurant
 nothing not to like 
 it was all incredible
 it s quite the perfect hotel thank you 
 nothing
 it was farther from the center of london than i had anticipated
 breakfast service is disappointing 
 keep well 
 no kettle
 didn t have the wine i liked in stock 
 nothing
 wines need to be stored in a temperature controlled cellar 
 not being able to stay longer 
 the price is prohibitive 
 des too hard 
 nothing 
 we liked everything
 high tea had slow service and forgot to bring cream
 nothing
 too expensive for a regular treat shame
 old
 room was a little small for a baby cot but kind of expected this in london 
 we were there on friday night came back to the hotel at about pm thinking we would like a quiet drink but there was very loud so called jazz being played in the only sitting area there was another bar area but we were told we could not use it so the only place was our room for such a large hotel there really should be somewhere to sit in comfort 
 the bathroom was small and the floor got wet when using the shower as there was no step or tray to contain the water made it slippery to use the toilet glass door got in the way of the entrance the spa facilities were poor and not very clean signage was lacking in the hotel made it difficult to find out where to go for the spa breakfast bar etc unless you asked staff
 the hotel was a bit further from kings cross than expected there was no draught lager available on saturday night
 noisy aircon unable to open windows unable to use stairs and had to use lift
 could not sleep all night as the people next to us were screaming and talking very loudly the room had a conjoining door this may have made it worse tried earplugs and knocking on the door but it didn t help the gym facilities were falling apart and very small 
 big negative for me was the fact that the windows could nt open so there s no fresh air in the rooms the use of air conditioning for air resulted in me getting a really bad chest infection the pay on demand tv system did not work for our entire stay and no proper effort was made to try and rectify it
 air conditioning breakfast trays were not removed when room was cleaned on one day i had to ring  times and ask for someone to take the tray away 
 the lifts are shaky for anyone nervous of these things the room got stuffy do needed aircon all night although weather unusually humid 
 having to pay for the use of the pool when i am a staying at the hotel terrible having to wait a long time to check in and out very poor and slow service
 after waiting for  hours over our check in time i finally visited the front desk after watching numerous older couples successfully getting a room key and after explaining that i was told to wait for a room and then watching other go through miraculously a room became available i felt throughly discriminated against because we was a younger couple then after walking around london all day we wanted to order room service after  trips to the reception and  broken phone we finally got  lots of fish and chips i never usually complain and this may seem like mediocre complaints but when it s your fianc s birthday you just want everything to be perfect highly disappointed 
 breakfast can be very busy try to avoid the rush after am the hotel has three lifts for the whole hotel and the stairs were closed for renovation can take a while to get anywhere during the very sumner season the london underground is a good   minutes walk from the hotel 
 my car was broken into in the hotel car park staff not in the slightest bit interested had to drive home on seats of glass the day of sightseeing in london abandoned
 location you really need a vehicle it s a  minute walk to the nearest tube station 
 it s  minutes at least from metro king s cross or russel station which is fine if you plan to stay out all day but it s a bit of a walk for some reason the alarm rang in the room the last day for  minutes and stopped hard way to wake up but overall everything was great 
 booking in and out was great for me my friends could have had slightly more friendly speedy service on reception long wait for lifts often very crowded
 location bit far from u g station you may need  min walk no attractions around the hotel 
 since being refurbished and changed from a holiday inn to crowne plaza it seems what were previously  good sized rooms have now been made into  cramped rooms not enough floor space to put your suitcase without having to manouevre around it all the time bed was lumpy and felt like springs were coming through probably the worst bathroom design i have ever seen the elevated shower tray has a lip of around maybe  mm and the shower head is positioned half behind the glass shower screen the end result is that everything gets soaking wet floor toilet toilet paper absolutely everything because it is all so close together in the small bathroom my shower flooded everything and passed through into the bedroom carpets and as a result had to change rooms staff were very helpful with this but really not the point breakfast is a standard buffet type priced at an astonishing  pounds per head if you buy in advance then you get vouchers and the price is discounted to  pounds i find it hard to believe that most people could eat  pounds worth of breakfast if costed at true value not good value at all and at times it seemed that certain items such as sausages were carry over from the previous day on arrival i was told that since changing to crown plaza then the free wifi no longer requires login or password what they didnt point out was that the wifi is now unsecured and as such my businness and personal applications on laptop tablet and phone would not permit me to connect kind of frustrating when you are travelling on business and wifi is important although i didnt see it my nose told me that there must be a swimming pool possibly at basement level reception smells strongly of chlorine location at best is ok but not great with a good   minutes walk to nearest tube or main station and the area certainly isnt trendy or smart and to get anywheer of interest etc involves a decent hike on foot tube etc 
 the only thing we said was that upon arrival to your room you get a free bottle of water and a small supply of tea coffee making facilities this is good if you re only staying one night but we stayed for  and would have appreciated the extra supplies 
 the room was smelly when we first checked in the ac was not working properly so at night i was sweating we turned the temperature to strongest fan and lowest temperature but still not much cool air it was a beating the distance to the tube stations were not that close but we discovered a bus number  that would shuttle us from king s cross to the hotel so we just budgeted extra  minutes to our trips to account for bus travel time 
 the room was not ready when i arrived i was told to come back at  pm which i did i then had to queue again this time for  minutes and it still was not ready 
 breakfast was fine but the staff that were on at breakfast didn t approach my table so made it a little difficult to grab somebody s attention when i had a question but it was perfectly adequate and very nice food 
 the only thing i would say that would make the hotel better would be that there doesn t appear to be any buggy or wheelchair access from the lower lobby reception area up to the belgio and breakfast restaurants
 the leisure facilities at the hotel were not well sign posted or advertised in your room 
 everything was perfect 
 service was atrocious initially i was told my room had been double booked so i had no where to stay then i was asked if it was ok to share a room with a total stranger staff were useless couldn t even get a tea bag brought up to my room 
 odd little niggles with slightly dodgy switches lights but nothing major at all
 i did not like room  where after getting out of the lift i had to lug my case down stairs in the hall i strongly resent having to pay for swimming pool in the hotel 
 the hotel has gone through a refurbishment and changed from a holiday inn to crowne plaza previously rooms were a good size and although a little tired were relatively comfortable now rooms have been made smaller presumably to increase number of rooms overall and are too small not even enough space to leave your suitcase somewhere without it getting in the way and overall feels claustraphobic windows dont open so you wake desperately needing fresh air beds are lumpy and it feels like you can feel the springs probably the worst designed bathroom i have ever seen shower tray is elevated and has a rim of about mm the shower heads are positioned so that you can barely stand behind the glass shower screen and the end result is that a lake is created on the bathroom floor and the spray from the water soaks everything from the bath mat to toilet tissue i had an issue with my bathroom whereby water was seeping under the walls and created pools in the bedroom carpet staff were very helpful in this instance but i had to change rooms and was upgraded to a club room which was a better size but same bathroom etc and mini bar was locked and inaccesible the hotel has also changed its wifi now no password needed but the connection is not a secure one this meant that my business laptop and applications would not permit me to connect same with some personal apps so as a business traveller it meant i couldnt work buffet breakfast is extremely expensive at nearly  pounds if you buy vouchers in advance you get  pounds discount but even then it is expensive and overpriced room rates very variable depending on which night stayed but range from around  to  pounds per night which is high it may be london but its not the west end nor the most glamorous of areas i beieve there is a pool in the basement but as a result the whole of reception area smell strongly of chlorine
 we didn t have time to take advantage of pool as we had plans with friends it took   hrs in an uber to get to gatwick airport
 having to pay as i went the computers were down 
 very slow reception staff not very welcoming considering a  star hotel more a free for all to get seen and staff do not listen to customers bad to see them smoking in uniform at side of restaurant was ok once there but expect  min walk if your good at walking to nearest tube station really bad for location 
 although it s only   you have to pay extra to use the gym
 it was a long walk from kings cross station with cases over rough footpaths 
 location was a little further from kings cross station than hoped for  mins walk but other than that all good 
 no information in room on the hotel facilities 
 the room was way too warm which made it difficult to sleep at night 
 business men in particular were assured more than casually dressed folk soaked from the sudden torrential rain while queuing to check in manually as systems were down that friday 
 i ate at the belgo restaurant one evening the food was only just warm the waiter did not offer any condiments and i could not get his attention again i ended up leaving most of the food as it was too dry some of the attention in the bathroom could have been better i moved to another room where the toilet was coming away from the wall but accepted this since i didn t want to be next to the lift the mini bars are empty meaning not even being able to have any bottled water late evening or early morning two times i went to the fitness and spa and not all facilities were possible due to cleaning these could be done out of hours but at least cleansiness maintenance was paramount the only complaint there is that they should visit the sauna there was wood worms by the door coming from the wood frames 
 charge to use the pool gym location a bit weird about a  min walk from kings cross
 it s far from a big supermarket but store in front was good to get something 
 we booked a room with  double beds but there was not one available and so we were given a standard double room the guests in the next room were very loud and partied with doors banging until am the air conditioning was noisy making a rattling noise all the time which seemed to become more noticeable when you tried to sleep the room was not overly clean and the remote for the tv seemed to be mood dependent when it wanted to work at breakfast the food was lovely but the dining room was a mess tables were not cleared there was cutlery missing from the table no one offered tea or coffee at the table or directed you where to find anything there was no printed information about the hotel or its facilities in the room we did not even know it had a pool or spa 
 parents allowing their children to dive in the pool
 see above
 the bathroom was designed with looks in mind but not practicality the oversized sink undersized tap shower without glass etc i think an art major designed this with no practicality in sight d
 we had complaints of noise when we had music from a small bluetooth speaker on a friday night as we were getting ready to go out for dinner ridiculous also you have to pay to use the poor or gym i don t know of any hotel that requires that 
 the hotel was a  minute walk from kings cross station with a suitcase this was a nightmare ended up spending more money on taxi fare and buses hotel staff in reception were not very pleasant and very abrupt never smiled and almost seemed irritated with me asking questions main toilets in the hotel were on level  in a hotel room as they were having a refurbishment when arriving at the hotel in the morning i couldnt check in until pm and needed the toilet what they didnt tell you was you needed a pass and anyone could just walk in very strange and i was not advised of any of this upon checking in overall very disorganised and customer service not great 
 i only know that they charge us to use the pool and gym their website is deceiving giving the impression that like most hotels those facilities are available to guests free of charge the location is also a bit far from the closet tube station though the name carries king s cross it is like  mins walk from the king s cross station and since king s cross is a big station it would take   mins from hotel door to platform 
 housekeeping cleaning of the room if you don t leave money housekeeping will not leave shampoo toilet paper and water location of hotel is great it s the real center of london breakfast is good but a bit expensive 
 had to pay extra to use spa facilities and wasn t part of the hotel as expected you had to go out of the hotel and into the cellar suprising after staying at other crown plaza hotels i emailed the hotel and got no reply
 few small details could have been better tv remote didn t work and there was no welcome note or hotel details booklet
 there was a long wait for check in however believe it was due to the ba cancellations so understand 
 there is an additional charge for using the leisure facilities reception staff discourteous at times 
 room service was very weird the waiter barged into the room without being asked to creating a very awkward situation he also didn t carry a card payment terminal 
 not much 
 location far from everything impossible to open the windows in the room lavatories in works at the lobby
 no computer for guests although i think there will be one in the future doorway to bathroom was narrow and the door had a tall handle so it was awkward getting in and out of the bathroom very little space between bed and desk 
 there are still some minor surface issues like the door leading to my room having had its handle removed looked messy but i understand the hotel is in process of transformation 
 the waitress staff at breakfast could have been more attentative i e asking if we required tea or coffee when being seated instead of us having to ask for it also on arrival at the hotel we were told that there was no booking for us yet i clearly had a confirmation email from booking com telling me that it was booked this caused us some anguish after a  hour journey the receptionist eventually sorted us out after a  minute wait 
 no complaints everything was fine 
 car park spaces were ridiculously small scratched our  plate mercedes due to one of your staff misguiding us in  for car park over night which is shocking breakfast was vile and everything was hard and cold ladies toilets were in the basement  floors from reception and was like a building site health and safety oh and only  spaces in the car park
 no complaints 
 i was asked was there a reason for the trip i said it was for my daughter in law and son s birthdays also there wedding annervesary which was all in that week of booking i had been informed they would have a bottle of wine waiting for them nil given 
 had to pay as we went along their computer systems were down and so nothing could be charged to the room 
 the room was very small for the price when using the shower it soaked the bathroom floor the hot food wasn t so hot and was a little disappointing my room was not cleaned nor new towels provided despite being out of the hotel for    hours not the service i expect for the price the staff were apologetic but not remotely sincere about it 
 never use booking com again had a nightmare and they don t actually make bookings who knew avoid at all costs nothing but hassle 
 trying to order room service took over  minutes a number of calls to reception that did not finish the call before putting the phone down and the kitchen restaurant not answering the phones also the worst part was the fact that all the systems were down so i was unable to get a receipt on booking in they tried applying a nd charge then on checking out still unable to get a receipt and still today i have been unsuccessful in gaining a receipt meaning i shall not be able to claim on my expenses for the accommodation despite a number of messages to the hotel and calls i still have not got a receipt very disappointing and would recommend booking com removing them 
 reception and concierge handled by trainees it system broke down a few days before and not fixed 
 bellboy was extremely rude when we asked to store our luggage asked us to drag our bags across the lobby just to drag them back then made us feel as if we were inconveniencing him when that s his job for  a night it s the least we expect 
 the gym was horrendous i paid  to use a few kg dumbbells it shouldn t list that they even have a gym value for money is terrible to be fair when compared to others in the area 
 the view and no porters to help with luggage 
 the cooked breakfast was practically cold this was on both mornings so was not a one off case we would have been better off going room only and eating out the staff were not helpful on arrival this was our first time here and we had no idea where to find anything it would have been helpful if they had asked if we had been here before and if not they should have a taken the time to tell us where things were apparently there is a bar somewhere reception staff looked miserable and unapproachable all in all not a very friendly hotel 
 being very picky but perhaps a mirror on the wall near to the hairdryer 
 wifi was not accessible in our room at all 
 when i came back to the hotel almost  pm my room wasn t made up i found this a bit annoying as i had been out and about since  am and had to go to the lounge to wait until the room was ready while at the lounge i waited what seemed to be an interminable length to order a drink eventually a manager came along spotted me and immediately got a floor staff member to take an order which was delivered promptly however when it came to paying for the drink i found it difficult to find any floor staff to pay and eventually went to the bar to pay for the drink the chairs in the lounge were a bit grubby in contrast to the room furnishings 
 i had to move to another hotel during the week end because the fare was too expansive but this is london 
 charge for pool i only have cereals for breakfast told receptionist this and there was no mention of a small breakfast when i said i didn t want to pay   for cereals toast and drink 
 after paying a lot you have to pay to go for a swim or to the gym the bath shower were a bit high and therefore getting into the shower is a struggle for small people
 the hot water for the bath never achieved anywhere near  degrees the room was very warm even though the ac was turned down to it s lowest setting and i overheard another guest complaining about this at checkout when i went to open the room door from the inside i happened to look up and there was a gap between the ceiling and the door frame of about   a foot filled with wires which was a bit disconcerting on checkout i was asked to wait while they checked my room for damages yup while they checked my room for damages that is literally what the receptionist told me i told her i was very insulted and she said i m sorry and then shrugged the shrug was the last straw i m not sure the british are very good with shrugs so i took it to the manager who was very receptive and listened carefully and promised to report the woman to her manager i wouldn t return again i ve had these problems with  star hotels before it s always better to go high or modest not somewhere that is trying too hard to live off the parent companies name 
 it was advertised with a spa but did not mention it was run separately from the hotel and had an extra cost to use the facilities very disappointed with the spa hot tub was out of order swimming pool so small could not swim and member of leisure staff not helpful 
 restaurant was on the expensive side i would prefer to give a tip than it be added to my bill shame about the hot tub being out of order 
 it was a little expensive for the food provided as after a certain time there was only sandwiches and crisps even though the menu said fries 
 the bed
 drinks in the bar were very expensive so we probably won t use the bar again
 the shower needs a longer door or a supplemental curtain 
 nothing
 lacks character and charm bar area is nice and breakfasts very good they charge you to use the leisure facilities even if you are a guest 
 location a bit too far out which we didn t really understand when booking our fault bit would have hoped for a nearer tube stop the bed and pillows were really uncomfortable and we had a bad nights sleep the queue for the check in was also really long longer than we have ever seen at a hotel at check in time the staff were also quite aloof and unfriendly compared to other hotels we have stayed in 
 when we first went into our room there was no kettle this was reported to reception at once as we would have liked a hot drink on our arrival i phone reception an hour later still no kettle at  pm we decided to go out for a walk and to have a hot drink else where on the way out complained again about the kettle on our arrival back at the hotel at  pm kettle was in our room 
 none 
 the room size for the price we paid very cramped not enough cupboard space we stayed there a week 
 they charged us   pounds to use the pool and fitness room the rooms are super small and there was no wifi for the first  days of our stay and when they did get wifi the connection was super slow i would not stay at a crown plaza again 
 pull out sofa bed wasn t made up on the first night like we re were advised but as i had a long day and the fact i was ill and already sleeping my auntie who was sleeping on the bed didn t want to call for someone to make the bed so slept with out and quilt or pillow the following night the bed was made up
 staff were not great we asked for our luggage to be picked up and said there will be someone there straight away i waited  mins before calling again and they then told me they were too busy to collect them i had  suitcases 
 we had heavy luggage and the walking distance was further than had anticipated easy route by taxi or bus 
 we rang to reception to find out about the spa to be told it was in the basement we then had to call at reception to ask again as the lift didn t go to the basement due to refurb work that was all fine except it gave the reception staff two opportunities to tell us we needed to pay to use the facilities which would have saved my hubby from having to go right back to the room for money jacuzzi then not working when we got in there did think the spa let the hotel down 
 overall this choice of hotel was disappointing personally location was not as convenient as expected and despite king s cross being included in the hotel s name it was not that close to the station being about  gbp taxi fare away 
 on arrival the receptionist spoke so quickly that we couldn t understand we were disappointed to find out we had to pay for the pool this was not clear on the website the jacuzzi wasn t even working and the pool was smaller than it looked on website i chose the hotel based on the photos of the pool so very disappointing the bedroom but especially the breakfast restaurant was uncomfortably warm more air needed in there 
 the pool was ice cold due to breakdown or maintenance but obviously couldnt be helped 
 charge of   per visit to swimming pool very poor show belgo restaurant evening meal too small staff unable to increase portion size indicating to me it s all out of a packet 
 i made sure it had parking but it really didn t and they charged  pounds for parking which they failed to inform i also booked in for breakfast it s was   and they charged me  and then had to go up to the room  times before the access card actually worked the quality of food from room service was poor and not cheap 
 there were smell of cigarettes in the room and for me as non smoker it wasn t nice i felt like being in ashtray 
 the room was way too hot even with air con on not able to open windows had to pay for pool facilities which was not stated on the website not cool water in the bath didn t get very hot 
 limited and expensive overnight parking expensive bar and the receptionist who didn t ask for the registration of our car which could have resulted in us being charged  had we not enquired later 
 too bad it is not closer to st pancras or near a tube station you have to walk at least min to get to a station or st pancras 
 the hotel was under refurbishment and some facilities were not available the closest underground station is kings cross station and it takes around  minutes walking
 had to squash against the wall whilst showering to stop the shower flooding the bathroom floor no refund available when we accidentally booked the wrong dates through the online booking system so we had to pay twice 
 difficult to put plug in bath due to fixed shower screen also the hot water not very hot for bath and shower yet hand basin hot water very hot
 i thought i d booked the holiday inn bloomsbury but got holiday inn kings cross bloomsbury although it is in fact a crown plaza hotel it was a good  mins walk away from where i wanted to stay i ll book hotel direct next time 
 gym charge not made clear but see above 
 nothing major but maybe a few more car parking spaces as we arrived friday to it being full and was so all weekend up until the sunday
 nothing but confused as booked holiday inn and no one said it had been rebranded as crown plaza
 would have liked tea and coffee access in room not only via room service to pay another   charge for it as well also be nice if leisure centre access included as free to residents not   extra
 breakfast was okay there s a good selection of food but eggs weren t cooked enough and black pudding was overdone pool closes to children at  hrs think this should be later as we didn t get the chance to use it and kids were upset 
 the rain shower was wonky so when turned on water sprayed everywhere when i adjusted the head of the shower the dirt that was on top of it was disgusting the staff where friendly but we had to wait a long time for bags to be put into storage 
 the booking for a smoking room was not reflected in my initial room assignment luckily they had one remaining if this is your preference you may wish to call ahead to make sure the room type you reserved is honored at check in otherwise a pleasant stay 
 the air con didn t work in the bedroom we were not able to open the window so extremely hot we only had one robe in a double room 
 i booked a smoking room and but was told there was no smoking room booking com must make sure it is only available to book when there is availability
 one member of staff was rude we booked a smoking room with a queen bed and bath we were given a non smoking room smaller bed and no bath when we contacted staff about this they came across rude and didn t accommodate us the room we paid for we expected the room we paid for and that s what we should have got 
 the hotel is situated a good  minute walk to the closet tube station so if you plan to get around london via public transport you ll need to factor in a fair bit of walking
 room was warm too warm in fact a day air con wasn t particularly good selection of tv also wasn t great if your not into sport good that sky sports was included but general channel selection was only adequate and movies were pay per view additionally the pool wasn t inclusive and should have been for this level of hotel although not expensive 
 got extremely warm aircon seemed to have little effect exacerbated by the windows unable to open at all 
 only complaint is that the room kettle should be inspected more often for calcification and cleanliness
 the room while recently renovated and is very comfy has a very bad bathroom design the glass screen only extends half way so there is no way that the bathroom floor will be dry when you shower as the water will definitely splash there 
 there aren t any restaurants nearby you have to take a bus to get to the main part of london however it s only a min bus journey 
 not a dislike necessarily but we found the tea coffee making facilities when we were checking out they are in a drawer this keeps the room neat and tidy but we completely missed them 
 the breakfast time was extremely busy and they constantly ran out of items so we had to keep asking hence having to constantly wait until they replenished this really was rather annoying also i would suggest bringing pots of coffee tea to the table for the guests so the guests don t have to get up constantly also the location is a lot further from a tube station than initially thought approximately  min walk so we had to uber quite a bit on an evening where typically we would use the tube 
 after arriving after a long journey a member of staff woman was giving us weird looks as if we were not welcomed there we were very tired and got asked a lot of u reasonable questions and got asked for two id cards one of the keys wasn t working either 
 we were told we were being upgraded to an executive room and in the same sentence we were told that the room was not very good but hey it s an upgrade we didn t understand why we were being upgraded to a smaller room surely that s a downgrade the bottles of water and chocolate and other little touches were nice but was not worth the upgrade 
 it was further away from kings cross station than implied i picked the hotel on the basis i needed to be on an early train and that wasn t ideal
 the walls had holes carpets look worn out and paint on walls wasn t finished needs refurbishment 
 not a good location with  young kids a long way to nearest tube station they say  mins but it s  a lot of bus hopping done it s now crown plaza group not holiday inn swimming pool freezing cold costs extra each day room didn t have enough bath towels for all of us or tea making facilities biscuits tv problems apparently just this weekend really annoying 
 the hotel rebranded to crown plaza the day i booked and it took over an hour to find walking late at night in the rain the hotel has now red exterior and crowne plaza signage not green and white holiday inn no one at the hotel or booking com thought to tell those who had booked that the hotel had chnaged name and brand these idiots are still calling it holiday inn for gods sake it eventually cost me  quid in taxis and going to the holiday inn bloomsbury to find it the hotel is the crowne plaza kings cross change the bloody name for gods sake and tell your clients bookers beware that said the rebrand and make over makes this a real premium hotel not at all like holiday inns the makeover is not  complet but prices refelcet this and right now its good vlaue 
 staff knocking on the door and male staff entering without warning plus we asked for extra towels but they didn t come we asked for a refund on our room but not sure if we got that though the assistant manager was sympathetic 
 the bar only had lagers and ciders no good if you drink guinness breakfast could be better had to wait for bacon my wife said that some of hers was cold 
 loud music from guests below us woke us up and when we informed reception at  am nothing was done the pool and spa facilities weren t available and that was one of the reasons why we booked the hotel 
 changing from hi to crowne plaza not sure on room allocations upgraded room was  double beds felt small breakfast on sunday was chaos run out of lots of things staff not effective slow
 wanted continental breakfast but the the meat cheese looked dried out the pastrys didn t taste fresh 
 most hotel kitchens seem to be unable to cook bacon properly this was no exception lack of a public lounge area and no toilets near bar or restaurant toilets where available in the cold basement below reception but where very poor 
 the restaurant staff were shockingly slow and rude no idea of customer service and no response from management when complaining very expensive menu as well this with rude staff who do not have a good understanding of english is very poor 
 perhaps a better design in the bathroom shower was next to the window so water went all over the blind road noise was intrusive better double glazing possibly 
 the only minor minus was  minutes walk to the nearest underground station but still not something big really 
 restaurant bar didn t have any dry white wine other than the house which was mediocre at best every option i asked for they were out only one salad option no soup but i could have walked to plenty of other places in the area now wished i had room was very warm and stuffy on arrival the room thermostat had a dial but only one temperature came out hot i don t like to sleep in a warm room so had very little sleep the point of me staying over night was to be well rested for an important meeting when i booked i asked for a fan as this is sadly the case with many hotels but had to request after check in but made little difference to the room as not fresh air to circulate and already hot on arrival i will not be using this hotel again 
 the layout of the room specifically that the desk chair backs right into the bed making it awkward to sit or stand and if there had been a guest with me impossible to navigate from the sitting area to the door or bathroom kind of an odd thing to do 
 wellness section is for extra price maybe just the only bad news for bookers but no more complaining 
 i had to pay for the gym my room service was due in  minutes and took  the salad i ordered was covered in olives despite no mention on the menu the towels were thin and tiny the fan in the bathroom was noisy and i was unable to turn it off terrible night i will not be back
 shower flooded the bathroom bad design remote took  presses to get a button to work one room key didn t work long queue at reception to get it changed toilets a long way from breakfast bread at breakfast was stale
 i was a little disappointed that the sauna was so small and i was a little alarmed about the light floating in the pool that had come loose i reported but the staff were fully aware and was in the process of getting it sorted out and although my room was lovely and clean i did see a pair of pliers that were left on the floor by the lamp that i luckily avoided stepping on as it was almost hidden by the curtain i also ordered breakfast to my room where some of the food items were cold so that was a little disappointing too but overall i had a pleasant stay 
 would have liked a wider menu in restaurant light bites and sandwiches at lunch time 
 nothing
 there were a small set of stairs between the lifts and the room may sound picky but with a big heavy case it was a real pain 
 lifts were very slow and over crowded we had to wait for  lifts before we could get in one there weren t clear signs to the stairs which we would have taken instead building work happening in the hotel which we were not aware of prior to stay and the hotel bar area was unstaffed when we got back for a nightcap at pm
 not the best view
 the walls are paper thin terrible nights sleep hours of coughing and snoring from the bedroom next door lots of noise from the corridor 
 no information in room about facilities meal times etc charge of   for use of swimming pool for residents is not acceptable 
 breakfast room very dated tea coffee out of flasks no poached or fried eggs fruit selection poor fan in our bathroom on all night asked for handyman to take a look told no one available consequently didn t sleep much first night but second slept like a log quite location
 parking i phoned to ask about parking to be told that there were  spaces but could not be reserved and were only available on a first come first served basis however when we arri ved no spaces available but two spaces had clearly been reserved ncp parking  mins away cost  for  hours
 would have been good to be made aware of the pool
 the food served in hotel was not the greatest the dining room was also not ideal but we appreciate this may be due to renovations
 in my opinion the breakfast could have been better choice was limited such as fried eggs not being available food was good quality only complaint would be the choice 
 the room was very small the bed too we go  towel everyday i had to call with my telephone as the phone in the room did not work for new towels every day 
 the only downside was our hotel room had only a shower and no bath 
 the restaurant and bar area seemed a bit depressing e g no windows and too crowded the location is slightly inconvenient but overall we got a fair deal 
 wanted to use gym but was closed 
 nothing
 the hash browns felt overly reheated soft instead of crisp 
  mins swift walk to nearest tube station russell square 
 coffee for breakfast could be better the breakfast becomes repetitive after  days over  mins walk to the nearest subway
 coffee and bacon at breakfast poor paid parking at  pounds was high should be split into shorter time periods
 most people traveling on business travel really early to make am meetings london being a metropolitan you d think people could book in at am at least luckily for me i could freshen up and get to court by am your staff from reception to pool breakfast and room service were all friendly and professional honestly was a pleasure being in the hotel 
 layout in lobby area was poor sliding doors were not open twice bar downstairs was not in keeping with the standard in the rest of the hotel
 due to renovations there were only lifts to get to the rooms not good for someone who is claustrophobic the one we got into stopped as it did not go to our floor the prosecco ordered to the room as a surprise for my husband s birthday was not there no hot water in hotel the following morning 
 don t charge  to use the lame gym in the basement horrible and i am a holiday inn rewards member so stupid from a business standpoint 
 no where to put  let alone  suitcases except floor or lounge housekeeping was a bit hit and miss cups and glasses not always cleaned replaced and carpet not vacuumed once in  days the restaurant was terrible we were made to feel belittled because we didn t have a booking webpage just says come and join us no mention of need to book when we could see spare tables for what we received the food was overpriced small portions and my salmon caesar salad was just a hot piece of salmon dumped onto lettuce with the barest hint of dressing croutons or parmesan cheese quite tasteless 
 staff were not very friendly and seemed like the guests were a irritant that interfered with what they were doing 
 empty area without any big chances for good meals breakfast ok but not available some foods for example fried eggs 
 wifi issues on the st floor although they were solved thanks to great customer service 
 when we arrived we walked up to the gentleman at the first desk pod and said we d like to check in he pointed towards  identical pods to his right and said reception there was no way to know which one he meant no signage and at that moment no one behind any of them we then saw a woman return to one so went to her and checked in the room was small and badly laid out could barely walk between desk and bed and could barely pull out chair enough to sit down the floor of the bathroom floods when shower used these are new rooms food was served in the basement as temporary measure while refurbishing badly photocopied menus and ill tempered staff we left and found somewhere local to eat though quite tired 
 sound proofing could be improved could hear muffled sound of neighbour ladies laughing and speaking air cond is also too noisy could also hear water passing through pipes as neighbouring taps were turned on and off 
 the fire alarm went off several times during the night the hotel is quite a walk from king s cross st pancras station 
 i did not enjoy the quality of the food in the breakfast eggs fruits nothing tasted really fresh and i wanted to have a cappuccino but it was not included in the breakfast rate they only give black coffee and the worst thing during my  day stay was the fact that one elevator was not working so there was a long queue to take the lifts 
 i thought the use of the gym and pool was included in the price but it wasn t you had to pay extra 
 breakfast was average porridge and bananas lacking no marmite or kippers in evidence rolls and croissants slightly stale but staff most helpful especially as we had a three year old child with us 
 no hot water endless queues to get breakfast i think we must have caught the hotel on a bad weekend 
 there was no hot water the air conditioning in the room didn t work so it was very warm wich made sleeping difficult there was a long queue for breakfast about a  min wait to get in simply because the breakfast staff weren t re laying empty tables quickly enough the restaurant was no more than   full and had more than enough empty tables to seat the people queuing there was still a queue when we finished breakfast and by that point the room was about  full there were a few staff who were wandering around doing nothing until unless somebody else told them to do something we arrived at breakfast around  minutes before it stopped by this point there were no fried eggs no mushrooms and no toast that seems inexcusable how can you run out of bread unless your planning is terrible 
 just wish i could ve stayed longer 
 nothing to like 
 will be better when all work is finished 
 it s a little sketchy from the hotel to kings cross
 the main elevator was not working so plenty of times we had to go up to the th floor using the stairs 
 water and drink in fridge i booked for one double bed they placed me in room with two single beds
 the wifi signal was intermittent but we just found comfy seats in the basement lobby where it was stronger there we could plan our day so it really wasn t an issue 
 late night major electrical fault in several rooms on my floor causing blue flames loud crackling noise at the wall socket in use and wrecking my device charger night staff were helpful in changing my room but i didn t feel safe and got very little sleep refund for the cost of a replacement charger the following morning was grudging 
 the room hot as the air con is weak and wimpy 
 the noise all night was a joke i stayed with a  year and  year old the night before disney they never got sleep with the noise at  we gave up and got dressed and showered
 the hotel is being renovated large areas are closed off and there is the associated noise and dirt associated with construction work the pool fitness area is only available at an extra cost and was quite dirty with evidence of a large amount work still needed the lifts were hopeless we stayed on the top floor and only  of the  went to all floor which meant getting from the lobby to the room could take  minutes the fire alarm was broken and sounded a number of times in the night ruining any hope of a restless night 
 standard so much lower than a  croissants were cheap imitations place was being renovated alarm system went off  times between am and am my  star room had an adjoining door with an inch gap st the bottom i could hear our neighbours every words wifi crap and cleaners didn t service room properly rubbish was not cleared bed wasn t made properly 
 the queues to get in the breakfast room were large once in there we had to queue again for hot food by the time we had waited for toast and eggs the rest of the food was cold more kitchen staff needed
 the only very slight issue was no room information left in my room but was ther within  minsbof reporting it awesome 
 breakfast was quite stressful due to the long lines waiting i understand that this was due to the refurbishment and we were pre warned 
 bed was small bathroom flooded from shower woken up at   by hoovering and drilling and banging staff were rude in terms of didn t tell us anything like where the lifts were or when check out was no book in room to tell us information 
 checked in with family around  pm given room keys for a st floor room upon entering room there was no sofa bed for kids had to go back to reception and queue again to be seen where i was first advised that i had not booked family room upon showing the booking ref where it did show the family room was booked we were given a new room on th floor upon moving from the st floor to the th floor the keys didn t open the door so had to leave the family in the corridor go back to reception again queue again to get new keys upon entry to the room the sofa bed was not made up so had to wait for house keeping to arrive to make up the whole check in period from first entering reception to actually getting everything sorted in the room approx mins which isn t good at the end of a long day when you have tired kids after all this turned on the tv and the remote control didn t work at this point gave up and went to sleep p s you have to pay extra to use the hotels own services i e swimming pool 
 perhaps bigger lifts but not an issue at all 
 no info on website regarding building work luckily not at hotel during day but if i had i would have been annoyed distance to nearest tube station was about a mile too far time in london is too precious 
 as there was renovations which didn t bother us the water supply got cut off a few times which i would have liked warning with a phone call from reception to inform us and give us a time frame about it 
 not enough lifts to hot in corridors no mirror for hair drier bath very difficult to get in and out of especially out of nothing to hold onto television reception very poor no long length mirror 
 basement not refurbished yet but if it matches the rest of the building it will be great signage to find the bar and other facilities was hard to find 
 the building was still to be completed following an obvious refurb the lifts were extremely slow waited almost  minutes before taking the stairs which were clearly being used to move tools and materials and therefor looked like a tradesmans stairwell 
 the layout of the breakfast was a bit strange cereals would have been better with the fruit and cheese instead of next to the hot food
 nothing not cheap but i expect this is a standard price in central london 
 i arrived very late in the evening and had a very early start and the check in staff were extremely slow despite no other customer being around the floor was a no smoking floor but the whole floor and corridor stank of cigarette smoke the location is shocking kings cross i may as well call any wherein the m near kings cross this hotel is situated in a dodgy poorly lit area not that near to the station as a female sole traveller it felt very unsafe 
 work still being done in the hotel and inadequacy of temporary signage makes it difficult to find your way around this isn t helped by every corridor on every floor being decorated identically like being trapped in a maze
 everything about the stay was perfect we had a great time here
 the breakfast was nice but i did have a slight stomach upset afterwards nothing too bad though 
 due to ongoing improvements to hotel the breakfast dining room was moved to a smaller room on our second day and the breakfast was cold 
 renovations going on so could be a little noisy at times 
 hotel under renovation noisy building works reception area drab and unwelcoming 
 the hotel was lovely the weather however was not
 restaurant food terrible hotel undergoing renovations the lifts were rubbish we waited for  lifts going up and down and ended up using the goods lift to get down
 the location did not feel safe i walked alone to kings cross station during the afternoon and was hassled twice by  different men the renovations do not compensate for the poor location 
 there was no fan in the bathroom 
 not very convenient for either king s cross or russel square underground stations 
 had evening meal a couple of times in the hotel and although the food was good it took ages to arrive  minutes and i was simply told the kitchen is too busy with room service need chairs to sit at the desk in the room to be more business friendly the concierge needs to smile more 
 very small rooms we had a superior room so i cannot imagine how small are the normal rooms also we found it very expensive for location quality of the rooms not so close from kings cross about  min walk tv not working staff did not repair it over  days but they offered us a discount on the room fair enough 
 room was really hot air con does not cool just recirc air and window cannot be opened complained and where moved new room was exact same 
 the room was cold but the staff provided a heater so okay would have liked a bathtub but the wet room was an excellent standard with a superb shower the food was a good standard though not exciting 
 room had  double beds and a nice working desk but made for cramped space wifi wasn t great in my room 
 our initial allocation of a room on the nd floor this floor has yet to be renovated and was a smoking floor we complained and were immediately relocated to level  which was terrific 
 the toilet malfunctioned on the last day reported to reception and they promised to sort it out it was not anyone s making but it was frustrating a bit 
 restauant menu was a bit boring the construction work on the hotel refurbishment was inconvenient 
 well obviously the renovations in the restaurant were a problem no real air conditioning on the hottest day of the year but efficient room service
 no hot water in morning soundproofing between us and next room was a locked partition door we could hear their conversations and other noises 
 the lifts in the building were very inefficient due to renovations taking place some time had to use the emergency stair well to get to the ground floor 
 nothing perfect stay 
 the construction noise from the hotel remodelling 
 it was a busy and crowded bank holiday weekend and there were real issues with only one lift seemingly in operation and an  floor building 
 there could have been a better choice of pastries for breakfast the cheese and ham were poor quality and unapoealing and cold croissants are awful more lifts needed and pool dominated by children till after   
 breakfast terrible for the price no choice more of a canteen look to it room in need off refurbishment hotel in need off refurbishment tiles falling lifts not working use stair most times my bathroom smelled strongly of urine 
 location too far from bus routes shopping and theatres i e not handy
 having read the advertisement for the hotel and drawn by the presence of a pool and a gym i thought the hotel very good value for money however i was disappointed that those facilities required separate payment and so have revised my opinion somewhat 
 location was a bit far from underground station and the construction was noisy in the day 
 during our  night stay the fire alarm went off  times in the middle of the night once in our first night and twice in the last the noise was deafening and sleepy people in night clothes came out to the corridor to see if there is a fire nobody even apologized for false alarms and poor sleep quality when we checked out although nearly each suitcase comes with a producer s warning that it should not be lifted by using the pull handle the luggage storage guy lifted the suitcases only that way and was really arrogant when i asked him not to two functioning elevators were far too few for a hotel of that size staying on the th floor we experienced it every morning that the elevator that was heading down to the ground floor was already too full when it reached our floor having started from the th by the th floor at the latest it was impossible to enter the elevator so make sure to ask for a room on the highest floor we could not find the stairs to use them instead no idea how we would have found our way out if there indeed would have been a fire 
 no dislikes was allocated one of the refurbished rooms and it was lovely breakfast also very good with a variety of fresh food to suit every taste 
 having major improvements but for  for  nights i didn t expect to be woken at  am to the sound of drilling under our window noise was terrible went to spa at pm the pool was full of kids so couldn t use it and a man was sat on side of hot tub in wet boxers exposing himself final night decided to eat in restaurant asked for steak medium rare which came back twice medium to well done for  you expect what you paid for so we went to pub across the road which was excellent we were given a discount of  per night at such high prices i will not be staying there again 
 the dining room was really small and very littleroom to move felt like every inch of space was a table so couldn t walk around easily the first day we ended up in a small alternative room the toast was cooked and brought down so was cold 
 drilling   mornings before am one other day woke up by workmen wifi was unusable from the room was told i needed to walk  minutes to get something to eat when we got back from a night out no night porter or food services at all pool gym only available to residents at   per person per visit 
 the construction works woke me up at am i phoned to reception several times and the problem was not resolved this was stressful and not what i had hoped for 
 the bedrooms were really tight to fit into the breakie was good food but quite chaotic and too busy to relax the two lifts were also soooo slow in one of our rooms the air con broke so we had to move rooms also the other room the bathtub blocked 
 staff arguing with each other in restaurant building work shower floods bathroom location to tube station and anything else cost per night considering above 
 system was down both in the evening and morning no real apology and even the chains twitter account fobbed us off think i ll be heading back to my usual hotel in london 
 wifi didn t work well the pay tv didn t work and i could not receive a bill at the end of my stay 
 strange  steps down to elevators was a mild drag for hauling luggage this was the absolutely worst thing 
 took  requests to get the sofa bed made into a sofa even having booked it however the receptionist was very good 
 only a service lift for people with limited mobility which was not working on the day we left there was a pool available but you had to pay extra to use it which was not made clear on the website 
 what i didn t grasp when booking was that when they said refurbishments were going on that meant a jack hammer on the floor beneath us at am the restaurant had gigantic ac units in the dining room i m sure it will be beautiful in due time and we got a good price due to the construction i suppose but it was not entirely done and the poor staff seemed harried 
 some areas were under renovation around us noise was not an issue however having to reroute patrons to an entrance to the elevator requiring the use of steps with luggage was a real pain close to bus line but about  min or more to closest tube wifi did not work very well from our room 
 staff were very cold and too formal just prepared to do the bare minimum i was surprised by the cold attitude the manager in charge has to be sent for hospitality training so that he can in turn teach and hire people who are hospitable and suited for the industry this was very different from all the previous holiday inn hotels i have stayed before what a waste great resources put to waste by unhospitable attitude of employees retraining on customer service and pr is an absolute necessity 
 hotel is under construction and disturbing noises start in the early morning free wifi but it disconnects every  minutes location is not the best place to stay poor breakfast far too expensive for what you get 
 wifi was really bad in the room and the whole place was being renovated so there was really loud noise all day this renovation was not mentioned while booking and the price was still very high despite this renovation i felt completely cheated 
 the nearest tube station kings cross is at least  min walk away the smoke alarm rang shrilly without any reason thrice on our first of three nights effectively spoiling the night s sleep 
 it was quite difficult to hail a taxi in the morning 
 noisy hotel under reconstruction relatively far from king s cross station mold in the bathroom we were awakened by the sound of the drill around  a m i would definetely not recommend this hotel 
 view from room building works this was probably why the cost was so reasonable
 housekeepers too keen and should check reception for who has checked out knocked and walked straight in twice when i was in bed 
 location was a min walk from nearest tube and walking back in the evening through fairly quiet streets was a little intimidating
 when we booked we specifically requested on site parking was told  for overnight stay when we arrived car park was posed and had been since january so we had to wks to another car park and paid  more poor service from booking com we had to report that bedtime had long black hairs on it tea cups and saucers were filthy whole stay felt like we had been cheated out of our money wouldn t stay again
 the hotel was undergoing refurbishment works so was noisy in working hours but acknowledge this is unavoidable 
 nothing really nearest tube kings cross  mn walk just marginally too far especially if you ve mobility issues refurbishment not yet fully completed but seems most floors now done
 breakfast a little disappointing hot food was lovely but very limited fresh fruit no berries pastries very dry and again very poor selection was not offered toast unable to toast bread ourselves
 there was lot of construction noise as renovation on few floors were going on the rate is too high compared to what they offer not worth the price we paid 
 staff were not very pleasant they seemed to do there job with efficiency but with little customer service motivation a friendly smile along with a genuineness wouldn t go a miss 
 no parking due to refurb outside of the building would benefit a clean in upper regions to reflect the clean inside but i expect this is in the pipeline after work is completed 
 thick yoghurt please 
 if i have to maker a comment um the lifts get a bit busy in the morning and staying on the th floor i was to lazy to use the stairs but otherwise nothing
 refurbishment in progress so only  lifts working for the whole hotel and no food available after pm not even bar snacks 
 refurbishment in progress only one of the two elevators would stop at our floor going upstairs downstairs was a nightmare room was quite small 
 the guy in the restaurant area wasn t very attentive i had to track him down to get a refill of water 
 they did not solve my wifi issues but instead ran me in circles with various excuses that were inconsistent some would say it s out of service other would say there are dark spots in hotel one tried to help for  second and gave up they seemed understaffed and willing to give random answers without trying to help i was there for business and won t return also non dairy breakfast options were inadequate 
 stop the bloody constant alarm going off and oh my god let the potential customers know that there is construction happening at the hotel cant believe all the above compared to the expensive price at the same time diagraceful wifi as my g network would be far better than their silly snail like wifi disgraceful for them to also charge to use the swimming pool   rating 
 the fire alarm went off at  am then noisy renovation going on in the morning but we weren t there to sleep 
 very disappointed to find no tea and coffee facilities in the room plus there were builders drilling in the room next door on a sunday morning which caused disturbance to our sleep 
 wasn t happy with the internet wifi signal very frustratingly kept disconnectin and the tv was difficult to use regarding your films opinion tried to press menu just didn t bother in the end however it s not like i d not stay again i did think was a very nice helpful staff
 the place is under construction so was woken in the morning and couldn t sleep in the day there should have been a discount 
 wifi is poor and you get kick out all the time so you have to put in the id and password again which is not friendly wifi is probabely the top on the necessity list having to keeping in the id and password is really pain 
 the extremely slow wifi and the  device only limitation there should be a shower door as well to keep water from splashing to the toilet 
 noisy neighbours at a ridiculous hour but was very well handled by staff thin walls 
 only issue was the noise was horrendous a lot worse than expected and very early in the morning all weekend 
 we know the hotel was being refurbished and from the comments on booking com and so we were expecting to stay in a refurbished room besides this we asked on the reservation for a room in the upper floors they gave us room  an old room where you can see dust everywhere and lots of faulty things you can also hear everything in the corridors and rooms nearby from people walking talking and having a shower it s definitely far from being a  hotel when i complained about not having a refurbished room at the checkout the only thing i was told was you should have asked 
 the construction was unpleasant and the un upgraded portions were lacking staff not particularly empathetic to the effect of the construction on their guests it s not as close to kings cross station as i thought the name is a bit deceiving 
 noise from outside and inside acoustic is not so good gym to be paid extra 
 we were unaware there was an extra charge for the pool as we were looking forward to a swim after a day of sight seeing 
 we were placed in a smoking room on arrival despite our booking specifically stating that we had booked a non smoking room this room was disgusting dingy and it reeked of stale smoke staff told us the hotel was fully booked and so we were unable to be moved that night we were also woken up by drilling at am 
 nothing
 we would have liked some information for tourists with a list of top rated restaurants in the area local travel services how to get to the main london attractions and local knowledge no services such as preloaded travel cards and a map of the area were offered luckily we had our smartphones with us otherwise it would have been difficult to navigate where we wanted to go 
 don t stay if looking for space
 didn t consider it value for money  pp didn t even include breakfast had to pay extra for a swim which i wasn t aware of until i arrived unfortunately on arrival internet didn t work and neither did tv 
 the staff were not good with english very surprising given we were in the uk the breakfast was poor the lifts inadequate for the size of the hotel 
 horrendous noise from building works aware that improvements were being made to some bedrooms but not informed of the sheer scale of noise coming from the extensive refurbishment of the reception area we couldn t get away from the noise both in our room and in the spa disappointed a charge now applies for the leisure facilities staff unable to help at times had to ask  members of staff the same question and none of them understood english 
 they claimed on there website that this was a   min walk this is completely incorrect we walked for approxamitly  mins from kings cross
 the car park had been closed for building work meaning that we had no where to park the car i was not informed of this prior to our stay and this was one of the main reasons why we booked this hotel the receptionist brushed it off like it was nothing and told us to park in an ncp car park costing us  extra in parking fees was not happy with this service at all
 breakfest room is hot and old style breakfest menu is simple elevators are slow and not sufficiant for such a big hotel maybe because of ongoing reconstruction 
 nothing
 building work meant that the common areas of hotel are limited and cramped breakfast was not great dining room lacks comfort or style although newly refurbished room felt too small 
 the hotel is a bit hard to reach it s  minutes walking to st pancras kings cross it s not a super pleasant walk i must say 
 the spa jacuzzi too powerful and steam room burning hot lounge area was poor
 very poor overall for money spent drilling started first thing in the morning room very expensive and dumped into non refurbished area lifts complete nightmare spent  minutes trying to get lift to ground floor not impressed at all barely adequate room at ridiculously expensive price the bedrooms that have not been refurbished yet shouldn t be used as not up to standard or offer them at lower price very disappointed 
 not the cleanest of hotels and lots of building works going on making it very noisy in the day the spa facility s charge also 
 air conditioning was adequate but would have liked if the window opened for some fresh air lock on bathroom was faulty but should be easily fixed by the maintenance dept 
 wifi didnt work very well but other than that no complaints 
 we stayed in room  wifi wasn t good at all it never worked the design of the bath made it difficult to get in and out plus the water never went that warm the tv had a very limited amount of channels compared to other hotels we have stayed 
 there was construction work outside but no problems couldn t hear anything in the mornings 
 for a large luxury hotel very tight with their complimentary items had a double room with  bottle of still and  bottle of sparkling water  kitkat and  packet of biscuits containing  biscuits with the coffee tea 
 the car park was advertised as open it was closed they did not advertise that you had to pay for the gym i have never heard of that before in a hotel the lifts did not work and they did not put up a sign saying so we were put on the smoking floor they serve terrible wine at the bar the place is under refurbishment and needs it the whole place needs it 
 building operations and lack of signage outside the hotel indicating the entrance made access a guess 
 it is implied that the gym is included in the price it isn t and you have to pay   the gym equipment is dated and doesn t justify this extra expense there is also work going on at the hotel at the moment 
 although there is air conditioning in the room the windows are screwed shut so you can t get any fresh air in the room a definite negative point for me 
 booked the hotel solely on the strength that there was parking and a punch bag in the gym arrived at the hotel to find there was neither parking was unavailable due to refurbishment forcing us to use a ncp car park down the road for  per night punch bag had been taken down ages ago according to member of staff on the gym desk although still showed it being up in the hotel pics
 this is my threatment upon attemting to checking in unfortunatley you booked through booking com unfortunatley you havent paid yet unfortunatley your room is not ready yet   and i had advised at booking stage unfortunatley your card is not authorized on checking in something went wronh with my card i asked were was the nearest atm and i withdrew the ammount from the same card and the same card worked fine everywhere else no attempt from the lady to try it out again at this point i was already feeling pretty unfortunate wifi was barley at my room   signal bar there are refurbishing underway and i would have loved to know if i was aware at booking stage the concierge on the otherhand were sublime in fact thats the only reason i scored better the service welldone to the concierge
 little bit of nose due to the refurbishment but nothing we couldn t handle 
 i booked with your hotel as it was meant to have a bath and on arriving it never had one do i was very dissapointed also i put the label on my door saying do not disturb but still room service knocked times aldo building was going on on it was extremely noisy i till report it but was told nothing could be done 
 the hotel is under going renovations you can hear the drilling the location is not ideal nearest tube station is  min walk the staff and the concierge were not not helping at all not we had to handle our bags out and in a stared entrance and when complained about the drilling the simply asked us to leave instead of offering some kind of compensation
 wifi should be complimentary 
 the size of the room was disappointing especially as ours was a supposedly superior room once the travel cot had been installed we could hardly move also storage was an issue both these issues made having the buggy in the room very difficult 
 the female reception staff english speaking levels weren t great had to get them to repeat questions on a few occasions walls were obviously very thin because we had the room next door complain that we were laughing to loudly at pm however come am the next morning their baby woke us up with its crying double edged sword really hotel isnt a close walk to a tube station nor is it located with any real tourist points of interest i personally dont care about that as im a londoner but i do feel its location is abit of a pain because you have to get a bus to the nearest tube if your not a fan of rain or walking 
 bar area needs an upgrade 
 we didn t know the hotel was undergoing renovations and when mentioned this to the concierge all he could say was that everyone was complaining about it and that it was on their website which we hadn t used to book they also said work was happening   but on the second day we were woken before  am with banging and drilling which was so loud the bed shook on the first day we ordered breakfast they sent the wrong one and by the time we got the correct one it was cold and rubbery it was a pretty stressful and unpleasant experience all round 
 bed was very soft my personal preference is very hard broken window latch so room got cold overnight faulty power outlet and wifi had a weak signal it only worked when i stood by the door 
 work been carried out at hotel which i was aware but not the fact car park will be closed also should have been clearer prior to booking closest car park  mins walk not great about am in the morning with rain hotel car park is very small not many parking spaces 
 the hotel is about a mile from the nearest tube at kings cross station which is not made clear on the website walking in the evening from the tube station along kings cross road was not very pleasant 
 building work going on to refurbish the hotel but stops around  o clock
 tv broke minor disruption caused by ongoing refurbishment no complimentary tea coffee water provided 
 the car park was closed no information given at time of booking rude ignorant unhelpful staff told me to go to another hotel that was their only offer of help i will never use this chain of hotels again 
 dissapointed we weren t told about renovations in progress and the car park being closed during the renovations 
 hotel parking is closed due to refurbishment so had to park in the ncp which was expensive also a shame there isn t a tube station closer by but that s hardly something te hotel can control 
 reception bar and restaurant area are all being refurbished later this year which will bring them up to the standard of the rest of the refurbed rooms 
 difficult to get a cab despite only a short walk to the stations it was raining clearly not the hotels fault though 
 the th floor has a constant hum it would be useful if reception staff informed guests of that when they arrive i had to be moved at am as i struggled to sleep 
 the first room was not what had been booked it was also on a smoking corridor although the room was non smoking opening the door on to the corridor was horrid the smell of smoke was pervasive i also thought the bathroom was tired grouting stained and unpleasant 
 not in the best location due to distances to tubes or kings cross but only a short walk or quick taxi ride  
 n a
 the hotel bar staf were not very friendly the larger was flat and not cold and when we complained we were not understood and were given the same flat drink the pool was smaller than we thought and busy 
 we couldn t use the pool on both mornings because it was full apparently they only allow max of  ppl and they charge you to use the facilities even as a hotel guest when we checked in they assigned us the old room which was outdated and the bed was worn down i literally felt veryigo just lying on the bed worst of all they gave us a room right below the renovation work so there were loud bangings drilling and sanding in the morning my month old woke up in a startle from the banging and sicked my husband was fuming because the staff at reception wasnt very helpful until he demanded to speak to the manager who moved us to a higher floor to the newly renovated room 
 it was an excellent place to stay s 
 on arrival i was given a room card three times i had to return to reception as the cards would not open the door on the occasion prior to my third visit to reception i had telephoned from the corridor telephone and was informed a concierge would meet me at my room with a new card to open my room door i waited almost  minutes for this to happen and then decided to return to reception where my room card was again exchanged and i was escorted to my room to ensure the card worked which it did at no point through this  minute experience was an apology given for the frustration the hotel bar also looked tired and the bar tender obviously wasn t aware he could keep the surface free from spilt drinks or polish the wood to reduce its stickyness my colleague that booked the day prior also gained a better rate for his room by  i use holiday as often as possible and usually have a very easy care free stay this occasion could have been better
 the staff have no customer service skills was put in a smoking room when asked to be placed in a non smoking we asked to be moved and was sent to the second floor where someone was bringing up the keys waited for  mins in gowns outside the room the resraunt was closed and was unable to eat i strongly urge you not to go to this establishment and i won t be using the company again
 wasn t as close to kings cross as you think   min walk depending how fast you walk 
 very rude member of staff at breakfast firstly it was noticeable that those who had breakfast included in their stay were shunted off to a side room which was far dingier than the dining room used for those who were paying extra for breakfast on asking a member of staff for some butter having been unable to find some on the buffet she rudely grunted that it is on the buffet and walked away the sauna facility in the spa was in poor repair especially considering the additional fee for use despite these minor grumbles the hotel offered great value for money and i would stay again 
 refurbishment was not announced from booking com in advance there was renovation on some floors but overall no impact for me to the stay during this visit as a new room was allocated from onset 
 refurbishment was not announced from booking com in advance substantial renovation on floors and lobby meant that as a business traveler it was not a hassle free stay hotel management changed me to a new room  day after arrival which was great but booking com should have notified of this situation upon booking this hotel 
 i didn t find the staff helpful at all i hadn t been in that area before and asked a few staff for advice on where to go for eating and shopping there response was short and not very pleasant breakfast was included in our stay but was cold and not tasty at all
 hotel staffs were not trained at all the receptionists were rude and did not have any qualities match to the hotel brand name holiday inn i called the reception because our heating was not working but she hang up before i finished talking i just could not believe it also the insite parking was closed due to the refurblishment but there was no information about it when i booked with booking com so we had to park our brand new car in the street around i made a complain when i checked in but the receptionist accused me i was wrong that i did not check holiday inn website that was very very rude of her saying and i was pretty upset if people book through booking com or expedia or other websites she should know not all people check their official site to get information in advance i was treated with almost all the people working there with no respect if you know what good service is because you travel around all over the world this hotel is not for you they are in london but they do not have mentality as british i recommend not to chose this hotel if you expect excellent service from famous brand name 
 the car park was closed as refurbishment going on this wasn t advertised at time of booking and car parking at an extra charge was a main reason for choosing this hotel we were disappointed on arrival to find no parking available had to park a  minute walk away 
 the beds sounds like you are sleeping in a carrier bag due to this one thing i slept only  hour the whole night the shower also naturally floods the bathroom making it unpleasant for the next person to take a shower when you share only one bathrobe for  people only  floor towel for  people plus floor towel useless due to extreme flooding in the bathroom 
 i walked to to hotel and although it s about  mins walk from kings cross station but i didn t realise its on a bus route with frequent buses to kings cross although hotel isn t near any tube stations its easy to get to kings cross for tube etc 
 second hotel we ve stayed in and we have stayed in quite a few that doesn t have a wee biscuit with the tea coffee tray 
 the breakfast was very good but it was expensive 
 tv was annoying water made skin burn indian restaurant not great but few options nearby when raining alarm went off multiple times during the night without any announcement thin walls changes in nightly rates were extreme as was cost of breakfast 
 the bath was too small
 asked for a quite room but was woken during the night by a noisy child next door or above me a few times corridor fire doors need improving to close quietly after noisy late guests fling them open 
 the fire alarm went off with  sounds at  am nothing was said about it they charge almost  per hr for wifi we stayed at another holiday inn a few weeks previously wi fi was free 
 room service food wasn t as expected and varied disappointingly from menu ie chicken and bacon burger had no bacon mozzarella and pesto panini had no pesto might sound like i m being fussy but if you re dropping   on a sandwich you least expect it to be right also the hotel was cheaper  a night due to refurbishments but this meant being woken at am on a sunday by loud banging and drilling that felt like it was next to our head we rang reception and they did stem the loud noises for an hour but was still a bit rubbish for a sunday morning even with the discount 
 no coat hooks in bedroom breakfast food was passable have recently had better breakfast buffet at another hotel my partner thought the hash browns were too greasy 
 they have some parking but they reserve it for thier managers not what they told me after i drove for two hours becuase they said it would be ok to get parked the recommended the ncp down the road in farringdon do not use it it is like a scene from a horror film and i doubt your car would be there in the morning 
 no halal in breakfast 
 a good  minute walk from train tube station expensive for what s on offer better quality hotels in london for similar cost
 a mix up on my booking made me quite annoyed when i checked in one receptionist couldn t do much to assist but another redeemed the situation and allocated me the room i had booked 
 the bed was uncomfortable mattress far too hard shocked at having to pay   each to use gym and pool never had to do this at any other hotel i hav stayed at as always been free for guests really disappointing
 wifi did not work rooms never ever had  square metres as advertised they had a maximum of  matresses were worn out 
 the bar staff were not very friendly the toilets for the foyer bar area and restaurant are in the basement which is too far away cost of wifi is ridiculous in this day and age wifi is generaly free everywhere i was thoroughly disappointed to see this hotel charged for such a basic service this would definitely make me think twice about staying there again 
 they put us in a diabled room for some reason the walls were so thin you heard everything soup dispenser empty hair dryer not working 
 staff rude and impolite
 limited parking spaces and expensive bedroom for what you get also food menu for room service limited to what u can order 
 the name is quite misleading as it s a good  minute walk from kx more if you ve heavy luggage and it s not really in bloomsbury smokers and cigarette butts outside the main door 
 unable to connect to wifi in room empty mini bar no complimentary drinking water far from underground stations charge for health club
 twice asked for a champagne bucket and ice to be delivered to the room once upon checking in and by calling reception from the room some  mins later it never arrived 
 hotel was expensive probably due to high demand rugby world cup disappointed at having to pay extra for wifi and indoor pool also major refurbishment is taking place on th floor so there was noise of drilling even on weekend this was not mentioned at time of booking 
 it is a good walk from kings cross not a bad location for what it is but i would suggest it is a   minute walk 
 shame breakfast wasn t included it is way over the top expensive it s a little bit out of the way of tube stations etc 
 the wifi connection is completely useless no matter how many times i tried and with  different login account i still can t login had to consume my roaming data 
 fire alarm seems to go off frequently causing lifts to stop working objected to paid wi fi
 we arrived to be greeted by a very grumpy receptionist who despite me assuring her i had followed all the procedures and requested a newly refurbished room as part of my booking kept barking at me that you had to pay more our friends who were also staying at the hotel followed exactly the same process paid exactly the same and got a new room we were not asked for a swipe of any card etc so then struggled to get anything in addition to the room room service was a joke we were woken at am by the smoke alarm and when we asked at breakfast how this had happened we got waved away by the staff as if they were trying to keep it a big secret the icing on the cake was the   my husband paid for a bottle of sparkling water from the hotel shop yes   our room didn t have any hot drink making facilities or water in the room so we needed something an absolute rip off and a horrible hotel with a dreadful approach to customer service do not waste your money i have stayed in many many hotels in london which have in some cases been cheaper but in all cases had a much better experience absolutely will not be staying there again neither will our friends
 we booked a smoking room as both myself and my husband smoke but were surprised that the windows didn t open at all although the air conditioning was enough to keep the room cool and air circulating it would have been nice to let some fresh air in even if it was from just a crack 
 the wifi wasn t free lame 
 no food even a sandwich after  i was travelling from europe arriving at am and i was offered a takeaway which would take hr to arrive
 wifi a ridiculous price air conditioning in room not working properly to be fair though we didn t report it so can t really complain

 thin walls could hear people next door no free wifi fire alarm went off in the night 
 staff could have been a little friendlier and the pillows were very uncomfortable that s it 
 slow service in restaurant
 pillows were too thick bit stingy on the sugars and milks 
 hotel felt a little tired but then they are currently refurbishing it 
 it was an extremely dated hotel needs a serious revamp 
 needed a little more space for  suitcases 
 didn t provide flannels small towels
 very crowded at breakfast
 room decor was a bit jaded and outdated but still clean 
 little bit far from tube station but perfect for our visit to friends
 internet didn t work in the room
 the room we were upgraded to featured a double bed made of two singles which kept moving apart 
 breakfast was low quality although many choices there are great restaurants next door howecer and stores nearby space in the mini bar and coffee maker in room was a bonus 
 nothing really 
 the corridors could have been a little wider for luggage a better iron and ironing board wouldn t go a miss and the tap in the bathroom was hard to turn on too however apart from that everything was perfect 
 fairly tight room for three people sharing
 the room is quite small but not out of the norm for europe there is very little room to have suitcases open 
 there s no where to hang up towels after a shower and the room was very compact 
 the metro was like min by walk and if you are planning to shop and use the metro it takes like  to champ elysees or madeleine or etc and when u walk back to hotel from the train station is all up the street so makes u more tired after a long day 
 instead of a door knob there was an opening in the bathroom door
 some staff were not very friendly took a while to warm up to you there was some miss communication with the airier pick up i gave them all the flight info but because they could identify the airline code they didn t send a pick up they could have easily called the airport or type in the airline code i provided but little apology was given they seemed more intent on blaming me for not receiving their email anyway public transport worked out to be much cheaper and easy thank you paris metro 
 it was noisy i was in a room in the ground floor which was noisy and not very illuminated 
 while we were lucky to be given an upgrade the room was smallish but this is common place in paris 
 nothing
 forget to ask about the airport shuttle 
  wish they their room service was actually  hours as mentioned unfortunately when we ordered meals by  pm the staff had already left the staff apparently was from the cafe restaurant next door 
 a couple of times when they were cleaning the rooms the staff appeared a little disorganized vacuum cleaners left in the middle of the halls rooms are a little small but well furnished 
 tv had only french channels no bbc cnn euronews english i find it unusual not having any newchannel in english where most customers were not french please control your payment one day before check out time i checked my bill one before my checkout day in my case there was a discrepancy between their room rate and booking com rate it was later corrected i had the print out booking com t helped me if it were on the day i check out there would be problem advise for booking com customers 
 at night you have to ring the bell to go inside the hotel and usually that takes time so be prepared to wait on the door from  to  min
 each night there were loud drunk people out on the square in front of the hotel it was not possible to sleep with windows open the sunday night concierge gave us wrong directions pointing us in the wrong direction to rue st jaque he was also unable to locate the first aid kit that the weekday staff had provided for us after getting a small cut on our last day the cleaning crew only gave us one bath towel lots of little mistakes that added up to a mediocre review the room was very small we had to dance around each other if we were both standing at the same time we preferred staying in the th as it was quieter and had more upscale restaurants and stores this was just our preference though 
 a weak stream of water like all europe we got used to it we herd the noise street but we were so tierd so we slept good centeral aircodition work on heat in april so its a problem if its hot days we had   zelius degree so it was ok for us
 the rooms are tiny and if you have suitcases don t get the standard room it s as big as my walk in closet also the view from the back rooms is of other guests windows i don t suggest get a front facing room 
 booked small double we expected a small room not child size double bed i am   and with my head on the pilow my feet were out of bed resulting in a poor night s sleep helpful receptionist explained the hotel was full but nevertheless moved us to a twin room for the second night sleeping in separate beds meant we had some room to move but again the beds were very narrow we would have liked a hotel bar area by lift looked like may have been intended as a bar but was not staffed 
 would be nice to have also some vegetables for breakfast 
 no complaints but do not go to boullion chartier restaurant if recommended it is cheap but not good food very basic long queues by locals as cheap ran out of food options early in the evening 
 wifi signal this is a permanent weakness in the hotel and it seems to me that room  was not the only which had connection problems as there were always guests in the reception sitting in the sofas taking advantage of the good wifi there was there apart from this issue i strongly recommend select hotel for those who do not mind to have a wifi operational signal successfully active only in the hotel reception but i do repeat this is the only dislike i can tell from select hotel and i shall be there again when i get back to paris 
 the tiny lift and very narrow staircase to the room and the limited space in the room i stayed in could be a problem if you have luggage 
 coffee machine at breakfast could be improved 
 there was no soap in the bathroom the night manager tried to find some for us in the hotel but didn t find any the safe was very small could not fit a laptop breakfast was so so 
 the room is a bit small for guests coming for long trips with a bigger suitcase
 the continental breakfast wasn t worth it worth going out or the hotel
 the bed was a bit hard for us but that s simply a matter of preference 
 i forgot a jacket on my room so i would have liked if they would have contacted me to let me know i had left it so i could make arrangements to collect it before i left paris to south africa 
 nothing
 everything was perfect merci tous i didn t have breakfast in hotel because we were walking all around paris all day with friends but other customers said it was excellent 
 all of the staff were very helpful and friendly except of one staff that he never satisfied our requests and inquiries he was not friendly and with short temper the breakfast is good and clean but does not have much variety there is no business center but they offer a tablet at the reception for customers when needed you have to walk  or  min to get to the nearest subway station 
 could have been a bit warmer in the bedroom but that is more our fault for not asking the staff to increase the room temperature i am sure if we had asked it would have been done this is being nit picky though 
 the breakfast starts at  while i had to leave at   i am not sure whether the labor laws in france allow it to start the breakfast at  but it would be nice 
 no restaurant and bar was closed at  i had no wifi in my room i complained  times to one member of staff and twice to another it never got resolved so i had to sit in the reception to use my tablet were they watched me do this
 rooms are on the small side although that s normal for paris location is a little more south than most tourist sites but transit is available 
 shower tiles joins had some mold that were almost completely cleaned after i mentioned it to the reception 
 all went well with me 
 wi fi is an issue select must solve at all i personally talked to them in a very positive attitude but it is undoubtful that i shall continue to choose select hotel as my staying in paris 
 bedroom small for an executive double little drawer or luggage space 
 nothing i loved the place only complaint which is very minor is that i did not have my shower cap replaced more frequently 
 hotel seems over designed design features sometimes seems more pretty than practical open bathroom design is trendy now and there s a shower curtain that provided some privacy but there s no bathroom door toilet is separate but there s no sink so you have to walk around to the other side of the room to wash your hands and there s no bin in the toilet
 elevator finds it hard to cope in busy periods e g morning checkout time 
 breakfast was just ok could have included eggs but that s very minor
 minor things the lift was a bit small there were no english language channels available and sometimes they were a bit slow replenishing hot foods at breakfast 
 the breakfast is the weakest link they have an outstanding breakfast at hotel des gobelins if they could have something similar i would never stay at a different hotel in my future stays in paris 
 the room was a little small and the breakfast area too hot at times
 the tv didn t work although we did not call for help the light switches were hard to figure out i wasn t able to turn on the reading lights on the bed without turning on the rest of the room lights not a big deal for a one night stay 
 the breakfast was a bit limited and the staff for this service were very slow most of the people were complaining about it
 elevator was a bit small but in a building this beautiful and old in such a lovely location that can quickly be forgiven
 the breakfast selection wasn t great and they ran out of a lot of things 
 we were up on the th floor and could not cool our room down since the air conditioning was set centrally very warm another disappointment were the directions from cdg airport that were given from the select website instead of the recommended bus we would take the train much quicker and easier with no transfers other than those two things we absolutely loved our stay and will be back 
 the cleaning staff was inconsistent and did not provide us with sufficient toiletries i e toilet paper soap so we would have to go down to the front desk to request them which was a bit of a hassle 
 rooms on the small side but man its paris and this is a lovely hotel to stay in and area to visit 
 hard to fault 
 nothing
 no parking 
 bedroom a little small but more than adequate toaster slow 
 neither the phone or tv worked but it didn t t matter that much we notified staff as we were leaving 
 room and bathroom were tiny could barely towel myself in the bathroom without hitting my elbows had to sit sideways on the toilet due to highly inadequate leg room 
 i didn t like the fact the toilet had no sink so you couldn t immediately wash your hands also the bathroom had no door and was right opposite our bed if one was showering and the other sleeping and the bathroom lights straight in his face and the noise of the shower i know there are better rooms we stayed in better and will make a point to ask for one next time 
 breakfast could have been better 
 i was given two single beds instead of the double that i booked this was not changed for the first two nights of my  night stay the cleaner used a very powerful and to me at least unpleasant room spray despite requests not to breakfast was poor 
 no thing actually 
 was twin single beds pushed together instead of double 
 some people will find the rooms too small for their taste we did not mind and were happy to compromise on space for the beautiful decor breakfast is just ok so book without and eat at nearby cafes 
 proper double bed rather than  singles put together 
 the maid service is iffy we stayed for  days and only had our room cleaned for  of those days although we left early in the morning and didn t return till mid afternoon the biggest problem is the design of the rooms especially the bathrooms it s as if the designer thought how can i make this bathroom as difficult as possible to use the sink takes up half the room leaving no room for storing toiletries but it s so badly designed that the water only trickles out because otherwise the sink would overflow the taps are round and smooth so you can t turn them off with wet hands which is kind of the point of using them you have to walk under the shower to set the temperature so you freeze or boil while doing so the rooms even for paris are extremely small so you end up with bruises from constantly tripping over furniture too bad because it s a wonderful location and the front desk staff are great 
 all was great with the hotel only thing was the fee to get a taxi back to the airport was  euros more going back because the hotel was booking it for us very very odd 
 nothing at all 
 rooms are a bit dated iron was old and leaked dirt on to clothes they could have cleared tables of used plates so we didn t have to
 room was really quite small limited with  bags as was the bed though you couldn t have got a bigger bed in there i know they are in the process of renovating some floors and maybe could add better lighting to the hallways leading up to room and bigger numbers on doors 
 wifi access was non existent in my room near the lobby and at breakfast
 i had searched for a three person room and was disappointed with the size of the room and that there were not three equal beds the third bed looked more like a sofa bed other than that it was fine location is good cleanliness could be improved we found a big lump of hair in the room all in all i didn t find that the hotel met my expectations 
 pricing is very high particularly for early spring 
 breakfast was somewhat limited 
 bathroom tap designs were absurd trouble to operate with wet hands or know which was cold hot pressure in shower but this was minor should not stop a visit 
 unable to access wifi at the hotel had to go to a cafe to access limited selection for breakfast as always as a solo traveler i was given an inner room overlooking the courtyard 
 room was on ground floor so very noisy every night and early morning and windows were on to street no full length mirror no extractor in bathroom so room hot poor lighting in room all yellow and none in bed area shower is boiling hot or cold no medium temp complained on check out didn t get anything back more of a oh well look 
 there was no dividing door between the bedroom and the bathroom no shower 
 we have no complaints at all 
 terrible room was not accurate to how the photos looked at all the room was tiny the floor was dirty and the room was so overused and old i could not believe how much we paid for such a horrible looking badly kept room 
 we stayed  nights booked a winter garden view room with bathtub arranged to the st floor which view was kind of dark and dusty at least not as shown on the photos no door for bathroom so makes room humid after shower also showerhands was weak hard to being able to take a good bath after long walk the facility varies from room breakfast was a bummer what matters is the service when i ask staff if there s any kettle or maybe the cleaner forgot the welcoming water the first day they provided the answers were always nop we don t have nop you have to buy it costs  euro so are u taking or not i don t think a hotel deserves a  star without warm hearts and trying to solving customers needs and provide alternatives my recommendation is that it s no necessary to be equipped for every room but be prepared for some needs that s what good hotel should do not sure if i was being picky because of this is my honeymoon at least this hotel has rooms for improvement 
 very disappointed with the wifi in the room no wifi at all when i was told it was later i was told it was the location of the room that the wifi was not working
 towel racks would be nice 
 we booked a deluxe garden view room with  single beds what did we get a room that felt like a cave with a double bed no shower and not even a door on the bathroom when we asked for another room they said they were fully booked and gave us a bedsheet and a roll of duct tape to create some privacy for the bathroom when we checked out we were charged the same price as the deluxe room the complimentary water had already had a few gulps from it 
 the wifi did not always work there was no hand wash facilities in the toilet the room was a little small the couple in the next room room number  were fighting in the hallway we reported them which stopped it for  mins they then carried on for another   hrs we went out to them on two occasions and told them to keep quiet as it was  am in the morning and they had woken us up 
 the shower fittings were very shiny and hard to grip but i gather they are to be replaced in september the overhead shower there was a hand grip shower as well tended to flood the whole bathroom as there was no lip to keep the water inside the shower staff 
 dripping tap in bathroom not a great shower fairly poor breakfast wifi only worked in the reception overall the staff location made up for both of these minor issues
 the breakfast has hardly changed in  years except they now add dry scrambled eggs and baked beans not good enough in such a hotel
 wifi signal not great or consistent the bar and lounge was just some chairs if i wanted anything from the bar someone had to be called overpriced for what was there my room was in a far corner that was dark hard to see where the keyhole was room very small housekeeping left the hose for the vacuum in the hall for most of the daay 
 nothing
 could be get the coffee machine to work
 coffee
 there was a few places that could have used a little more detail when cleaning 
 nothing 
 took a while to get key from night porter to busy on his phone 
 wifi was lousy attitude of staff was at times unpleasant breakfast was unappetising and tasteless 
 all ok
 the contemporary bathroom sink was terrible in design 
 the doors automatically slam when you close them it s a little annoying because of the noise
 nad
 very poor breakfast variety considering the hotel star rating i had no internet connectivity during my stay in it 
 too much deodorizer or scent in the room
 expect a better breakfast
 breakfast in paris hotels is not the best this is no exception

 nothing we were very happy 
 nothing i was excellent 
 nothing
 wifi is not acceptable way too slow or not working at all
 breakfast options could be improved to include for example also some salad
 wifi not consistent in room

 hotel noisy thin walls 
 nothing
 breakfast is somewhat limited concerning a  star hotel 
 wi fi was very poor in our room
 small bathroom weird door for the toilet 
 no wifi in breakfast area
 shower and bathroom in general could be better
 breakfast was poor
 nothing
 scrambled egg was hard not particularly inviting
 wifi could me faster 
 the internet it was so bad
 breakfast was very sad no eggs each morning

 the size of the rooms and the quality of the internet were poor

 pretty small room and poor breakfast
 only one thing poor wifi connection
 nothing 
 nothing
 staff weren t very welcoming and friendly
 wifi is not the best and coffee at breakfast could be better
 patchy wifi in the top floor rooms 
 room really small bath even smaller and the shower was half broken
 there wasn t anything that stuck out as being negative 
 cheaper breakfasts 
 everything was good
 small elevator
 sound insulation between the rooms is not perfect no big deal though 
 some difficulty in getting tv to work
 small room
 small beds small room for  people
 perhaps a conversion to english on tv channels
 there is no bidet at the toillete
 nothing
 location is really convenient 
 limits on coffee provided had to request additional tissue 
 the room too small
 i met some friend at the hotel and each of us had a different rate price the gap was big 
 breakfast terrible coffee and stale croissants
 late checkout only available for almost a full night s fee 
 nothing 
 small rooms are very jammed there is no minibar or kettle in these rooms 
 room is bit small and the bath tub wasn t practical at all 
 n a
 the doors of other rooms closing was a bit noisy some weird edges and trip hazards in the room 
 none whatsoever
 bathrooms are a bit of a trial
 no room service no bar
 marginal wifi only real irritant
 the price of the taxi to the airport totally over rated 
 wifi connection was terrible
 all the staff showed great help except the old reception man in the morning shift  july  he was not cooperative at all and he ruined my morning i hope the manger will do something to improve his attitude 
 stuck in a lift for  minutes no stuff member came to talk to me or assure me was told to wait for at most an hour imagine i was suffocating in that small lift i was rescued by a friend who came an opened the lift the technician arrived after  minutes terrible experience the technician who answered the bell could speak french only hotels should have technicians for a crucial thing as a lift on standby 
 the lack of a spa was surprising given some of the other high end hotels in the area
 the room was warm we slept fine but usually like the temperature a little cooler but enjoyed our stay 
 forniture of the room is quite elegant but old aged if you want to drink something at night you must go out because the bar closes before midnight 
 there is no lobby in the hotel that is a problem entrance is too small and the door opens and you are cold there when you are waiting for some one 
 the laundry charge was too expensive i feelt like i m being overcharged somewhat 
 nothing 
 not much not to like perhaps the carpet in our particular room could use a good cleaning quite a few stains the light system was a bit overly complicated to use and it is unnerving to have the lights go completely dark while one is in the restroom 
 nothing
 nothing we didn t like
 the room had a lot of dust sad to see such wonderful furniture lamps in need of a good dusting that is my only negative comment staff was excellent they were the best 
 the room was long and the windows were positioned so high we couldn t look out of them 
 the front desk staff very condencending less helpful they called me thinking i have ran away without settling accidentals and the were speaking bad things in french unbeknown to them my colleque understood french bad considering the rooms were paid only  for water and tourism tax 
 beautiful bar restaurant that they closed bcs of low occupancy we believe paris is strugling after bombing attack however instead of cutting cost they should invest in guests that do visit their hotel so they return wrong service mentality 
 breakfast could be much better and bigger but than again french are not known for big breakfast buffets 
 everything was to expectation 
 so much dust behind the nightstands that i sneezed the whole time i was in the room definitely not a  star hotel also didn t feel safe to leave valuable goods in the room 
 they didn t clean the room for  days we had to tell the reception the room was not very clean the carpet was very stained for the money we expected nicer 
 room was a bit dark but other rooms probably are not if the rug were changed the room would have seemed like new bathroom was very large and nice 
 there was no restaurant bar lounge or proper concierge on duty a fact of which i was not informed until we arrived and were pointed to the cramped cafe across the road in a week of rain and cold having to leave the hotel for every meal was not acceptable the room was compact with the shower within a high bath and on one occasion only one yowel given to us we ended up having breakfast inour room on a tiny table huddled like back packers this is definitely not  star 
 the housekeeping and cleanileness is zero the service is below average for a  star hotel there are very few options for food from room service and the restauraunt was closed the furniture is really old compared to what i saw on the website not child friendly at all wifi was bad 
 wifi went out tv went out no ice machine they made beds but didn t clean the room breakfast was terrible and room service was twice the amount of what you could get right across the street 
 some rooms not that good
 no window
 no fitness no sauna
 nothing
 room was not clean very old style and very not like the photos on the website highly disappointed for a supposed  star hotel 
 the toilleteries in the bathroom 
 not much would like some more varaiety on breakfast buffet 
 water had chlorine in it and affected my hair
 nihil
 staff friendly but not helpful
 food smells in the left
 absolutely nothing 
 the quality of the room s internal finishes is not a five stars level 
 buffet breakfast was too pricey so we went out there are many parisian breakfast options locally 
 nanny service sometime we this for our small children
 staff excellence
 nothing
 corridors boiling hot leaving the room aircon struggling
 nothing
 nothing really
 smell in the room dated interiors
 i had a fold up bed
 room without a real window they charged the room twice on the credit cards and did not pay back yet
 it would be great to make a small reparation
 worst bathtub placement windows can be bigger room needs more daylight 
 high quality breakfast buffe but with limited choices very small reception
 the worst  star hotel i ve ever stayed in 
 nothing to dislike
 internet connection was poor 
 nothing
 none
 arrogant staff 
 hotel completamente obsoleto 
 the restaurant bar
 room was very dated and small 
 many things bed in living room internet wasnt working during all our stay etc
 small room tired looking
 wifi connection is the worst and hardest to connect
 hotel is quite ols and needs to be modernized 
 the room was too small the bed size was very small no tea or coffee maker at room the staff wasnt friendly
 bar was closed for renovation 
 every thing the service is so bad and poor and the breakfast also so bad the room is so bad very old furnuture
 fairly bland business hotel but excellent value and location 
 would have been nice to have breakfast however at e per person was way beyond our budget 
 the hotel doorman was the rudest and most incompetent staff i have ever met i asked him to call me a taxi for the airport and he got me one coming after  minutes while there was a line of taxis right at the corner having seen that i asked him to watch my luggages time for me to see if i can get another one at the street corner the man refused saying i am on my own finally i went with my stuff and got the taxi immediately since  of them where queuing worst groom ever 
 no food after pm at the bar but yes as room service
 hardly any vegetarian options
 very discourteous staff except people at the front desk rooms too small beds uncomfortable housekeeping and service staff rude
 bar service was a bit uneven given that it was the end of the evening and they appeared to have been very busy before they recovered though 
 their room service i asked for tow empty glasses to my room they told me i will pay  or i can come myself to take them from bar and this what i did 
 the food options available under room service were less but then again it is so close to some really amazing cafes and restaurants at bercy that one can quickly step out to grab a meal if they do not want to leave the hotel 
 other than for breakfast restaurant didnt open for other meals during  night stay mould build up in showers is a dead give aeay when it comes to house keeping standards
 the rooms are little old the breakfast is ok 
 breakfast very expensive although an excellent buffet with lots of choice hotel probably more suited to business travellers hotel restaurant was closed on the sunday evening i stayed 
 we some problems with the cleaning staff not coming back when we left the card on the door saying to come back later or if we left the card stating to do not disturbed we were interupted 
 nothing 
 price of room service city tax added at the end of the stay even though we paid it via booking com 
 cleanliness of the breakfast room ask your staff not to put bread clumbs on the floor as at the end of breakfast at   am the room does not like very clean 
 when we arrived they told us that our booking was canceled but i did not get any email from booking com and they arrange another room but because of availability we had to pay extra for upgraded rooms whic were available 
 the toaster in the breakfast room was not working very well but that was all we struggled to find out where the car park was to park the car but finally pulled into the hotel and were helped immediately 
 offered room upgrade for a charge which we took as we were checking in for only one night at pm a complimentary room upgrade would have been nice gesture part of upgrade was free mini bar but there was no alcohol just one beer a small bottle of wine would have been nice 
 it would be better if one more blanket can be provided in the room 
 more choices for halal muslim food tq
 little bit far from main attractions i e the eifel tower but there is good cheap bus services right outside 
 we didn t like the fact that when we arrived at the hotel to check in we requested to give our credit card in order to block  euro for guarantee this was something that we have never been informed for before also this caused us a big inconvenience because we didn t have this money available for our holidays at last it became much more difficult as according to our bank s policy this money will be released in  working days 
 there was a noise from what sounded like to room next door humming like air conditioning through the night the mirror in the entry was not clean 
 the staff at the restaurant absolutely missing service education doing comments about other customers bad welcoming at breakfast 
 could not change my booking from twin room to standards room since it was booked through a website very unhelpful service and quite arrogant the holding fee on my credit card was hold for  weeks because the reception staff forgot to release the funds 
 my own stupidity at getting off the wrong metro station it s not bercy metro its the next one my bad not the hotels
 bed was a tad soft staff removed the mattress enhancer for us which made for a much more comfortable sleep 
 a c
 would be nice if there was a pool 
 not much we drove this time and parking charges are quite high in the nearby public car park so a deal for hotel guests would be nice 
 nothing
 too far away from champs elysee and eifel tower about min with metro i think it is time for renovation however a nice hotel 
 the only thing that this property could use is a pool that would be the only thing that put this property over the top other than that there are no issues 
 restaurant close at   pm and if you like late dinner you should order from outside 
 nothing
 sofa in a broken state and not meeting the standards of the room
 the employees at reception desk seemed very busy and a bit artificial i did not feel they were very interested in the guests 
 liquor prices baileys irish cream is way too expensive compared to premium whiskeys ie  oz of irish cream sells for  eur compared to  oz of glemorange whiskey  eur knowing that that bottle of whiskey costs  times the bottle of irish cream dosage price should be reviewed relatively
 the price of a bottle of wine in the bar was ridiculous  euros 
 food is very expensive and parking at hotel is  euro a night which i find way over priced for staying in the hotel gym is extremely small could do with more leisure facilities especially with kids 
 they did not change the bed sheets for the  nights and not able the cab park next to the main entrance i fell in the stones of the entrance
 location is far from central paris i lost my charging cable for my camera inside our room 
 room not set up for a woman unable to use hairdryer in bathroom assume for safety reasons so i had to plug it in by the desk no mirror near any of the outlets so had to use my facetime camera on my computer to look at myself while i dried my hair located in a business center neighborhood while there is a metro line close by that goes straight into town without stops that s no substitution for being able to walk out the hotel and take a wander in the neighborhood that would not be recommended in this location not scenic and sidewalks walkways especially difficult along the seine unless you have business very close by this would not be the hotel for you gare de lyon is an arduous  minute walk if you walk fast and it s really difficult if you re hauling a suitcase even if it s small of note when using booking com you will not receive loyalty points you only get the points if you book directly that is really low 
 very strong air freshener smell in hallway on our floor
 our stay was too short 
 little oversights here and there we were a group of three friends staying in one room but the extra bed didn t get made with the same fabulous comforter and they only provided one robe and slippers for the three of us upon request an extra blanket was provided but not a proper comforter and i m sure we could have gotten extra robes as well if we had asked another friend stayed in one of the upgraded rooms with a nespresso machine but the room hadn t been stocked with nespresso pods and it required a call to the front desk a very good place overall as i said it was just little things here and there that keep it from getting an even better score 
 tv in main room didn t work lamp in main room didn t work lighting wasn t the greatest broken lamp taken into consideration fridge wasn t stocked up daily valuable item of clothing went missing from our room
 tables for two at breakfast are a little too close but if you are in a bigger party you are more likely to be seated at one of the circular tables in the centre of the room bar service is extremely slow on our third visit we actually gave up waiting 
 on arrival despite booking a superior double room we were given a twin room on valentine s day when we went back to reception to tell them they had made a mistake the receptionist s quick solution was to say can we push them together for you top marks for thinking on he feet but no eventually got given a different room two floors down the bathroom towels were stained and dirty marks on the ceiling in the bathroom room service was very slow and the champagne glass had a chip which was very sharp we were informed breakfast was served until   on checking however on monday when going down to the restaurant at   we were ushered away saying they were closed as they were only open until  at the weekend  per person the iron in the room was broken this was replaced but the old one didn t get removed and got kept in the corner of the room hoping this was only a one off 
 i have seen  hours after your confirmation that you wrote nonsmokers preferred therefore i wrote promptly a mail to you direct to your mailadress with the exakt name and date of booking and i want both rooms f r smokers sorry to say i did not receive any answer when we arrived the booked rooms habe not been available at   and not the following days and they habe been nonsmokers from your really friendly personal i received no comment to this all other services have been pleasent and professional 
 paper cups for tea coffee facilities asked for better cups twice both times where given more paper cups no fresh milk no creamer asked again was given more coffee sachets at these rates i expected better 
 nothing
 price of food and drink very high breakfast although a good choice the hot food was luke warm to cold there was a mouse running around the bar
 there s just one elevator to reach the gym  level no stairs and it might therefore take a while in busy times when everybody is going to upper floors
 to expensive for valley parking dirty room small gym nothing like the picture cold food at the breakfast 
 heating didn t work in room problems with wifi tv didn t turn on minimal assistance from staff in response to queries about sightseeing etc mistake in check in info supposed to incl breakfast
 not much to dislike 
 we were in room  facing south and the main road very very noisy
 front desk staff was incompetent we had friends and family calling the hotel to get in touch with us but the front desk operator gave info to our friends that we had not arrived yet and that our reservations where canceled and that there where no body in that name at the hotel in spite of us staying at the hotel wrong information was passed on he also had no clue who the guests where totally unfit for the job 
 it was very noisy in our room due to traffic noise
 i have stayed there  times before there seems to be no record or continuity no way that they recognised me as being a customer who had stayed several times before that was disappointing
 we had a double room in a corner of the floor that was large enough but only with a small door sized window in the corner room  if i remember well this was not as booked online 
 a little far from city center
 they have to add more items for the breakfast
 we booked  separate rooms through booking com this had not been communicated correctly with the hotel and only one room was ready on arrival the staff were very apologetic and dealt with this straight away there was then confusion on check out as to if the room had been paid for we didn t have any nice views from either of our rooms the location of the hotel is in a business district type area 
 only staying for three days 
 would have been nice to have a pool within the hotel 
 the wifi in the rooms could be improved the signal was very weak in our room 
 everything okay 
 the sofa cum bed was uncomfortable for the kids to sleep the rain shower is the bedroom upstairs is too close to the wall kept banging my head into the hand shower location is a bit off for leisure travelers 
 we have been reserved in certainly adult  rooms when i went in the afternoon at  pm in hotel that there was only bed for two person in the room although many times expressed in desk and on the phone i want to room change for  persons as the contract but it did not have to change even after been eating dinner there is no subject to change at all i m very angry so i said why do you sell this room tricked into three rooms to two room for me finally changed the room for  persons contain in extrabed but heartfelt apology is not visible it is very uncomfortable experience to me about paris 
 it is not near the places for tourists but with metro using it you can come over this problem 
 the food and alcoholic drinks were so overpriced that it was actually cheaper to eat and drink in nightclubs and high end restaurants than at the hotel the breakfast buffet constantly ran out of cutlery glasses and soft drinks often they were never replaced until the staff were asked the rooms had very low wardrobe space and hardly any clothing hangers some rooms had international plug sockets while others did not some rooms had windows that could be opened while others did not 
 a member of our group drove to the hotel the price was advised as  upon arrival the fee was  on the machine and then he was charged just short of  even though the concierge advised that he would not pay this i will be in contact with the hotel regarding this excessive charge on a minor i was disappointed that soy milk was not available at the breakfast 
 no facilities at all in the room almost unbelievable no kettle even
