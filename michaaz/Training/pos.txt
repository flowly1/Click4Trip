 only the park outside of the hotel was beautiful 
 no real complaints the hotel was great great location surroundings rooms amenities and service two recommendations however firstly the staff upon check in are very confusing regarding deposit payments and the staff offer you upon checkout to refund your original payment and you can make a new one bit confusing secondly the on site restaurant is a bit lacking very well thought out and excellent quality food for anyone of a vegetarian or vegan background but even a wrap or toasted sandwich option would be great aside from those minor minor things fantastic spot and will be back when i return to amsterdam 
 location was good and staff were ok it is cute hotel the breakfast range is nice will go back 
 great location in nice surroundings the bar and restaurant are nice and have a lovely outdoor area the building also has quite some character 
 amazing location and building romantic setting 
 good restaurant with modern design great chill out place great park nearby the hotel and awesome main stairs 
 the room is spacious and bright the hotel is located in a quiet and beautiful park 
 good location set in a lovely park friendly staff food high quality we oth enjoyed the breakfast 
 the room was big enough and the bed is good the breakfast food and service on the hotel is good outside the hotel there is a big park which is very good for walk in the morning and evening many people are having picnics and do some bicycling 
 rooms were stunningly decorated and really spacious in the top of the building pictures are of room  the true beauty of the building has been kept but modernised brilliantly also the bath was lovely and big and inviting great more for couples restaurant menu was a bit pricey but there were loads of little eatery places nearby within walking distance and the tram stop into the centre was about a  minute walk away and only about  or  stops from the centre of amsterdam would recommend this hotel to anyone it s unbelievably well priced too 
 style location rooms
 comfy bed good location 
 this hotel is being renovated with great care and with an appreciation for its unique structure and location my spacious and comfortable room had a large double paned glass window onto the lush greenery of the park the breakfast selection was spectacular all considered this was a great hotel for the price and i plan to return 
 it was very good very historic building that s why i chose it 
 this hotel is awesome i took it sincirely because a bit cheaper but the structure seem in an hold church close to one awesome park arrive in the city are like  minutes by tram and is super easy the hotel inside is awesome and really cool and the room is incredible nice with two floor and up one super big comfortable room i ll come back for sure there the staff very gentle one spanish man really really good 
 great onsite cafe amazing building park location amazing bobby gin and tonic 
 we loved the location of this hotel the fact that it is set in a park away from the busy centre of dam square was great the tram system was brilliant and easy to handle the hotel is lovely and the bed was comfy staff were very friendly and helpful and familiarized themselves with us when they realized we travelled from ireland 
 public areas are lovely and the room was nice but the window was broken and the drains in the bathroom smelt its an old building and clearly has old building issues 
 i liked the hotels history and for such an enormous hotel i can t imagine how many girls were orphaned i liked their breakfast it was a quirky mix of fruits pastries meats and fish breads and the regular bacon and eggs juices tea and coffee 
 friendly staff oostpark a few yards away good continental breakfast selection quiet and relaxing area 
 the breakfast was the only positive element of this hotel original in taste and a good selection of selection of health food dishes on the buffet we did not try the restaurant but the whole set up with its view and terrace on the park is exceptional we had a wedding in the hotel s chapel so the convenience of just walking upstairs after the party was our reason of selecting this location 
 the location is good you need min to min walk to the center depends on your speed the hotel locates in a beautiful park and have a nice interior design the bed was really comfortable 
 bed was extremely comfy and the staff where well spoken they also gave us all the help with easiest way to city centre and all the relevant transportation tickets and unique locations to visit will definitely be returning as this city is beautiful and the people are so friendly 
 lovely hotel with extremely comfortable huge double bed we stayed in the split level room which we really liked if you have difficulty getting up stairs request if you can stay in a room all on one level the oosterpark is beautiful the shops and restaurants are great with lots of variety to choose from you can get the metro close by min walk or the tram is a short walk away and runs from the station and you can get off within a  mins walk to the hotel all in all a beautiful hotel with friendly staff shampoo and soap in the shower tea and coffee facilities in your room and in a location that is more relaxing than the central amsterdam we will be returning 
 great location in the park near museums and restaurants perfect launch pad for many walking and day trips beautiful old building former orphanage and spacious rooms big breakfast spread perfect for starting the day off right friendly and helpful staff i m
 the hotel itself is in a lovely location a min if that tram ride into the center train right outside the hotel easy access to everywhere the staff are super friendly and always on hand to help and advice wonderful bright comfortable and clean rooms beds are amazing felt as if we were sleeping on clouds bathroom was clean spacious and airy we had shampoo body wash there alongside hair dryer towels safe wardrobe hangers clothes holders desk chair room service hair dryer fridge kettle and cups teas and coffees it literally has everything you need in the room perfect hotel couldn t fault it at all the lovely smell from the restaurant downstairs is great tennis court outside the hotel little pond as well and a huge park to walk around 
 great hotel original concept style
 the hotel itself is beautiful restaurant is very good and the adjacent park is gorgeous with beautiful birds and rabbits 
 the hotel is located in a beautiful old monastery building which has a special mood combined with all modern features there is a big park just opposite to the hotel public transportation and a nice bakery for breakfast are also close good wifi all around the hotel 
 the staff were so friendly and helpful plus the bar restaurant area is beautiful located in its own park and the old building is simply stunning 
 friendly staff the bar restaurant area is lovely and overlooks the park very modern 
 the hotel is going through renovations and unfortunately it means that the rooms can be less than perfect however the staff did recognise those shortcomings and did everything they could to make the stay as agreeable as possible 
 the room was very big spacious the bath tub was large enough for two people i love the axcess to the from multiple trams and trains the park location was amazing
 very nice hotel manager he upgraded us because we had troubles with two different rooms they do everything to make you feel welcome and comfortable the park directly in front of the hotel is amazing rent a bike directly and make a tour also the bathtub and bed is great 
 the building meeting rooms modern style of my room park
 very nice hotel located in a park ca  minutes by walk to the city center not typical for amsterdam since most city hotels are located in small buildings but pay attention to the fact that most of the rooms are two storeyed so you will have to use stairs to get to bed 
 the location was amazing the room was fantastic east access to public transport set on the lovely oosterpark lots of places to eat and drink near by or nice walk to the main areas of amsterdam i would definitely like to stay here again i only had breakfast at the restaurant on site and this was only once and fairly standard as a brit and a connoisseur of cooked breakfasts i was a little disappointed in the hot food but generally lots on offer for everyone just no where does a cooked breakfast like the english but very helpful staff and a nice place to sit with a coffee and start the day and this is the least of any worries due to their being so many good places to eat around and i personally prefer to wander and explore for my dining experiences but not qualified to give a true opinion of the restaurant it was certainly busy in the evenings which suggests its pretty good i will definitely be staying there again if possible the next time i take a trip to amsterdam
 location on the park with easy access to tram lines was very good 
 the hotel is nicely localted directly within the park which is accessed when walking out of the building the building itself has great history and wonderful architecture the staff is very helpful and friendly when in need of anything 
 nice restaurant although felt breakfast was rather expensive at   per head location as expected but with hind sight a little further from the main tourist areas than we might have liked but was quite nice to be out of the noisy city centre staff very courteous 
 love the design of the renovated product the park nearby for a walk 
 staff were amazing very very friendly and proud of the place they work in the cafe is very cool will be back
 the brunch to purchase in the morning was good 
 the location of the hotel is super opening out to oosterpark the staff was very helpful and friendly the bed was very comfortable the room was spacious enough for  people 
 massive bed
 the hotel looks really impressive set in a beautiful location the room was clean well decorated and the bed was one of the most comfortable i d ever slept in 
 the quality of the hotel was brilliant and even though it was under renovation there was no disruption or noise the location of the hotel is far enough away from the centre of the city that it did not feel like a tourist trap and it is also situated in a fantastic park near some great bars and restaurants i cannot fault the staff facilities or the price and would highly recommend this to anyone 
 clean and new
 my room was upgraded because they are doing renovations in part of the building the room i was given was enormous and very comfortable i wish i had been staying for a week not just one night 
 the location and views 
 the location in a quiet park with a great terrace the space and the rooms are exquisite with a lot of taste the gigantic beds pillows and bedsheets are super comfortable it s dark and silent which is something impossible to find in amsterdam staff was very friendly and accommodating the restaurant with a view over the park is great to work and eat
 beautiful setting in a lovely park room very spacious clean and comfortable bar area looking over the park was stunning located on the peaceful outskirts of the city but very easy to travel around on the tram system old building with a modern refurbishment it suited us perfectly
 good and comfortable mattress near tram station helpful people from recepction
 the hotel is lovely and the staff were amazing they even sorted out booking a meal and taxi for me when i emailed them about this when i first booked online this was such a good idea as we found out after that it was one of the best in town it is set in a park and just looks amazing from the outside and inside is top draw too i would highly recommend 
 location in the park cool interior design comfy bed 
 location was good but needed tram subway to get to centre of amsterdam room was nice but stairs were hard to get up and down to get to bed at night room was clean hotel was nice and modern located in next a lovely park staff were friendly 
 the location was perfect and so beautiful only a tram ride from the centre anywhere really 
 basically everything the style of the hotel is really great the breakfast is really good good quality food really really nice coffe order from the bar the wifi was good in my room and also throuout the hotel the location is near a metro station its easy to get to the center i loved this hotel honestly and i will stay here again for sure the staff cares that you have a good stay i really liked that thumbs up from me 
 the property is beautiful

 beautiful design comfortable room friendly staff quick tram to leidseplein and metro to central 
 the bath and shower room was amazing beautiful hotel they are going through a refebishment at the moment and i am looking forward to when it is complete to see the final look which i think will look even more stunning then the building is already

 the whole hotel was very clean the staff were very healpful and friendly the dinning area is very modern and relaxing the rest of the hotel has hints of age to it but it works really well the room was exactly how the pictures looked very clean comfy and modern would definitely stay again 
 the location on the park is excellent and very peaceful the restaurant cafe in the lobby is a wonderful environment and they make excellent coffee 
 funky rooms well designed hotel friendly and helpful staff comfy bed 
 hotel was really nice staff were very friendly and helpful i requested a split level room which they gave me when i arrived the room it self was extremely nice and clean and the bed was very comfy the hotel is not in the centre however is a walkable distance or easily got to by the metro would definitely recommend this hotel and will be returning 
 we have stayed here a few times and always enjoyed the fab rooms there are renovations going on that have just made the place extra special our room  was just gorgeous 
 the location is beautiful i m sure after the renovations this will be a lovely hotel 
 beautiful room that was ready early with the most comfortable massive bed backs straight onto the park can t wait to come back when all of the construction is complete we didn t hear anything building work related whilst staying loved the atmosphere and feeling of all the areas of the hotel especially the hall to our room 
 we like the building although still under construction it has a nice atmosphere of course location is perfect near the city centre and the parc 
 the room was lovely great hotel beautiful location 
 the restaurant opened  days before however the food was good especially the burger good breakfast with fresh orange juice wifi in all hotel
 beautiful restaurant with great food and a lovely park to look over quirky and grand in design with relaxing rooms staff a very helpful and chatty it s a unique place once completed its going to be a fabulous venue we are keen to return in the summer
 the bed was really comfortable and loved the style of the hotel room bed upstairs bathroom modern and lots of glass and gloss the food was absolutely gorgeous 
 pretty building interesting rooms 
 room changed quickly when we had to complain about the cold and strong smell of new paint free drink card to make up for renovations inconveniences 
 rooms were large and modern and hotel was not a normal chain a lot more interesting and quirky
 large bed 
 it s a beautiful hotel or should i say will be when the renovation is finished 
 good location cheap 
 anyways the staff was extremely friendly no complants there location of the hotel is about km from the nearest metro station the rooms were tidy and the beds were good to sleep in however there where several small faulty details unfinished renovation in the room like lamp on the floor nails sticking out of floor which rips your sock etc so nothing major but adding them all together it makes this as a three star hotel in my opinnion 
 beautifull buiding next to oosterpark friendly staff great breakfast 
 great room very comfortable bed nice and quiet fantastic decor and amazing staircases the location is great if you want to avoid the hectic nature of the city centre and red light district but can be walked in around half an hour the immediate area is fantastic great park amazing local restaurants frequented by locals etc one of which has the largest selection of beer available near by brewery that do tours not heineken and great beer good museum near by and even a local coffeeshop that we better value than those in the center 
 we upgraded to a larger room had the bath infront of the bed which allowed us to relax before having the best nights sleep i ve probably ever had due to the comfort of the beds 
 a very quirky hotel that managed to keep its identy despite moderisation situated in a lovely location bed was extrememly comfortable and cleanliness of hotel was outstanding 
 beautiful surroundings great location old world style of the hotel is really different
 location
 location was ok and has access to all the public transport a very pleasant park is situated next good for a jogger or just a stroll 
 the bed was amazing actually our whole room large room the park burger at the restaurant downstairs was also heaven 
 super comfy beds cozy rooms lovely staff pretty sweet location i love amsterdam 
 staff were brilliant really helpful attentive and friendly amazing building with lots of history too 
 great customer service staff very responsive to our individual needs also helpful in giving directions getting tickets and metro passes 
 the rooms were comfortable and clean and the bed accommodated sleep well restaurant and bar staff were very helpful and friendly the breakfast was quite good where there was a variety of selections available to choose from 
 good water pressure in shower
 the hotel is located in a very nice area of amsterdam there are museums parks shops and restaurants around as well as many tram stops that can take you everywhere in the city staff were very kind 
 we upgraded our room had a huge room with a large bath tub 
 vibe is good location good and historic building is will be beautiful
 generally clean and interestingly designed but a little worn meanwhile there is massive renovation underway which will probably make it a much nicer hotel but in the meantime you will walk up a wooden ramp to reception and many amenities are in process the reason to stay here is that it s cheaper than other similar properties possibly because it s in renovation and also because it is off the beaten path though not in a bad neighborhood just not close to the hot spots 
 architecturally the building is terrific you can feel the history of the place which just isn t there with purpose built chain hotels the arena has the look and feel of a boutique hotel lushly decorated wrought iron work on staircases chandeliers the up lighting and high windows and ceilings gives a great sense of space location is fab in the green space of oosterpark but only a ten min walk to the city halls the rooms are quirky with a small footprint the ground level has a closet small sofa wc and shower fridge table and chair with the huge bed on a mezzanine level there s a tv on each level 
 breakfast was very nice and the staff were so helpful especially with giving us advice on transport around the city also the bed was comfortable so we slept so well each night 
 this hotel was great value for money only a few tram stops away from the city centre it was close enough for all the attractions of amsterdam but far enough away that it was a quiet neighbourhood the zoo is literally a  minute walk away or one tram stop very accessible the room was extremely nice and the bed was outstandingly comfy best nights sleep i ve ever had i would highly recommend this hotel 
 very friendly staff lovely comfy room
 food recommendations were brilliant
 the inside of the hotel is very classy he staff are friendly and helpful our room was great huge bathroom with double sinks and showers small sitting room with a kettle and fridge beautiful bedroom with a big comfortable bed the hotel is a nice area there is a big park next door and it is only a  minute walk to the heineken experience 
 bed was really comfy and we had a canal view which was nice to wake up to the hotel was warm and beautifully decorated we were given a free drink voucher to compensate for construction which was really nice
 the location of this hotel is great it s very close to the tram lines and subway the staff was very helpful in getting us a room that was to our liking the breakfast buffet was fine 
 breakfast was plentiful although often cold when meant to be hot bacon sausage etc next to park which makes for a pleasant evening walk and tram services nearby staff very friendly willing to help 
 well located if you don t mind taking the train 
 this beautiful building has huge potential but you get the feeling that while the extention work is going on the hotel is less of a priority it is starting to look frayed at the edges but there is a good and funky atmosphere and the breakfast was very good the location was also perfect for us as we were visiting relatives nearby and it is also a quite airy part of amsterdam 
 liked the staff the location
 special ambience of old convent and medical institution converted into a modern style hotel relaxed atmosphere nice restaurant and bar area with terasse good accessibility of public transport 
 room was a great size and comfy bed
 the staff were lovely and very helpful bar and restaurant very good not far from all attractions very good tram links

 bed was comfy with duck feather duvet and pillows we stayed in a deluxe split room and it was very nice reception staff bar staff was friendly and helpful

 the staff were very friendly and helpful and our room was amazing the bed was really big and so comfy

 the style of the room was unique and amazing with a light room laminate floors and a stunning black bathroom our kingsize was very comfy and spacious the hotel itself is very beautiful and they have kept the original staircases and high ceilings all of the staff spoke english perfectly just like most people in the city and i couldn t fault them on anything they were always willing to answer our questions and even gave us a map and told us where we could find some interesting places hotel arena s location is pretty perfect as it is less than a  minute walk from a tram stop to centraal dam square rembrandtplein and any other places you might be interested in exploring it s also right next to oosterpark so i can imagine how nice it would be to go to in the spring and upcoming summer really loved this place overall and a great hotel to stay at especially if it is your first time in amsterdam as it was mine 
 location was great for us as was close to my sister there was always someone on the desk the bars were lovely the building was impressive but building work going on which we didn t know about but i m sure it will look amazing really funky room 
 the bed was super cosy the staff was nice the hotel isn t central but if you get bikes it s very close and easy to cycle 
 staff were fantastic and changed our overall view of the hotel got off to a bad start room  was tiny and they changed us no argument bar staff and reception staff really friendly and pleasant 
 cool hotel great receptionist who gave us ideas of what to do in amsterdam delicious supper at the hotel and great shower 
 bar and restraint staff were great reception was a bit lacklustre also th bathroom walls are completely see through wouldn t advise number  s if you are sharing a room 
 the staff was very nice and friendly the size of the room was really great and the style of the hotel is also very nice the bed was quite confortable 
 average good accommodation big room helpful staff room cleaned daily big hot shower comfy bed 
 the only good thing about this hotel is the friendly staff and the way it looks considering they have work going on location is great mins walk to tram stop n your in damn square in mins also we bought  day travel ticket from the train station for  euros n the hotel sell this for   euros so buy from hotel it s cheaper trains are not included in the hotel travel card but u won t need trains if your staying in dam only to and from airport 
 the place looked amazing and it was close enough to everything that walking was not a hassle
 bed was nice

 the decor the atmosphere the welcoming staff the room was incredible
 the hotel is amazing beautiful interior we weren t disrupted by the work going on as the place is sound proof our room was fantastic the only thing i should have done was ask for a fan at reception because the room temperature was too hot and the air con wouldn t go below oc the room layout with the bedroom upstairs was lush

 polite staff 
 the staff we encountered were absolutely delightful and very helpful the rooms were clean stylish and comfortable the hotel was conveniently located within walking distance of the centre of amsterdam 
 nothing
 staff was vey pleasant the place is very well designed
 location is good it takes  mins by feet and   mins by tram to get to the city center 
 the room was stunning did not expect the quality standard received after having to walk past a building site and enter through a dodgy back door will definitely recommend 
 very smart room good food 
 breakfast staff
 staff helpful but maybe because of building upheaval hotel history and architecture a real treat would stay again try another room and see the hotel when fully refurbished possibly have a discount due to the visit being in middle of a bulding site and not as expected when booked 
 the hall
 nice staff good rooms with separate little living room and bedroom did not experience any problems with the reconstruction 
 staff were really friendly hour front desk beautiful hotel the room i stayed in double deluxe was amazing lots of restaurants nearby for good food and easy trams into central  mins i highly recommend 
 very beautiful building cozy room cool bar 
 staff were very friendly on arrival we were upgraded on arrival fantastic room with lovely no fern decor there was works going on outside the hotel but we never heard a thing and it didn t make a difference would definable return to the hotel arena
 close to tram excellent room nice staff 
 good wi fi 
 good location next to the tram but is under going a major revamp no noise problem but the lovely garden is gone sill good value for money this is a big place lovely old building 
 the best thing at this price excellent price in relation to the modern and spacious room received 
 character of the hotel was great location was good
 hotel and rooms were beautiful my friend and i wanted some luxury on our trip to amsterdam and this hotel provided just that the staff were extremely friendly and gave us lots of advice on where to go local life etc you will need to get trams metro from this hotel which all added to the experience of our trip would definitely recommend this hotel 
 the staff were extremely polite and helpful i honestly couldn t fault them the room itself was clean and comfortable and the location was great 
 friendly staff place is very clean and charming beautiful restaurant and bar food looked i didn t try it way better than the usual amsterdam culinary sins
 this was our first time in amsterdam and the staff were incredibly helpful they took special notice of the fact that is was my birthday and were so friendly 
 great location lovely room
 very nice property stylish hotel friendly staff spacious rooms except the one with stairs and close to the city center just a couple of stops by tram 
 boutique atmosphere good size rooms with comfortable beds and stylishly designed bathrooms 
 it was a well kept hotel in a lovely area the staff and services offered were excellent we felt it was a great value our beautiful room with a view was a bonus 
 the hotel is beautiful the pictures here arent doing it justice at all right on oosterpark which is awesome the location is great walking distance to the tram public transport to anywhere and   mins to poi convenience shops and small local bars on the quieter part of the city you can also get to the city center by walking but it will take about  mins very clean room made and towels changed everyday almost perfect 
 crews being nice and helpful environment quiet and peaceful but unfortunately certain areas under construction 
 the bathroom and sofa are so good the building style is really awesome 
 we liked the location and the extra pleasant staff they were very accommodating to our requests e g extra towels and specialty pillows 
 i loved the hotel design and decoration staff were extremely nice always helpful and smiling that is something you really appreciate when you are on a  hour business trip breakfast was way better than i expected although coffee was quite bad that is something most hotels fail to nail and i think most guests find it important rooms are fantastically cozy clean and comfortable 
 the bed was comfy and large the wifi was fast and good separate living area powerful shower
 got in late and hadn t eaten  hour pizza delivery offered at front desk brilliant at pm friendly staff and wifi in room hotel is  mins walk from dam square nice to be away from the hussle and bussle in town 
 we stayed at the hotel for  nights hotel is a bit far from the center but with the tram and metro you arrive at the center in minutes hotel is situated in a quite area the rooms are very spacious comfortable and cosy the staff is very nice and helpful
 really enjoyed our stay at hotel arena staff were fab made us feel really welcome even made us a coffee at am whilst waiting fir our taxi to the airport
 the matress and pillows were exceptionally good best sleep in terms of comfort ever i would be grateful to know your suppliers as would like to replicate this comfort in my own home 
 although the hotel is a little from the main centre the hotel itself was outstanding the hotel is currently under construction and expanding its capacity and restaurant bar space i was shocked when we arrived to see a construction site but you couldn t hear any building work from the room and the hotel was impeccable inside fantastic value for money but i assume once the construction has been completed the hotel will be one of the top places to stay in amsterdam the bar and restaurant is an added bonus to the hotel and the staff were pleasant and polite the hotel is spectacular and the rooms are modern and very comfortable the previous reviews regarding the bathroom walls are true but we didn t find that an issue i would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone especially for the location as many trams lead to the centre of amsterdam in only   minutes 
 great bed bathroom beer garden decor staff and food 
 this is a fantastic place to stay and felt like true luxury despite the amazingly cheap price that we paid for our stay there is work going on at the moment but we were given free drinks which were delicious and would both love to return to see the hotel when all the work is finished as it is such a fantastic place to stay that is steeped with history also the shower was incredible 
 we loved our stay at hotel arena the hotel was great staff was really kind especially for job the guy encharged of the restaurant and sander the guy who recieved us in the front desk talking to them it came up in the conversation that my boyfriend and i got engaged the day before arriving to the hotel that night when we got to our room there was a great bottle of champagne and a beautiful congratulations card waiting for us un our room it was a very classy detail we were so thankful about it also beds and pillows were great the breakfast boufett awesome and i woukd also recommend to have at least one dinner at the hotels restaurant food is great thank u for everything hotel arenaaa 
 everything the friendly staff super comfortable bed we did not want to get out of bed in the morning it was so comfortable the artsy decor of the hotel chic bar it was truly pleasant to stay in hotel arena

 staff good location suited us

 how different it was from other hotels the staff the bar area and the location was good for tram access
 this is an older building with a wonderful refurbishment our bedroom and bathroom were state of the art and perfect the dining experience was also excellent we had a problem with one meal but it was fixed immediately will go back

 the staff was very friendly and helpful in organizing our daytime activities hotel located in a quiet area but very close to subway and restaurants 
 we stayed at the hotel at a friend s recommendation it has great access to public transport and plenty of shops and places to eat close by laundrette around the corner is also a bonus for long term travellers who need to freshen things up having access to the back garden was an added bonus for lovely summer evenings would definitely stay there again 
 super location on division underground line direct to heathrow and central london older facility but very accommodating staff good breakfast many restaurant stores   block away bathroom was tiny with no fan or ventilation so it got warmish quite comfy but small rooms beautiful garden in back overall a great value for london would stay here again 
 breakfast buffet was more than satisfactory plenty of choices for all bed was very comfortable bathroom shower was powerful and plenty of hot water location could not have been better very short walk to underground beautiful gardens at the rear of hotel very quiet in spite of being close to earl s court rd staff was friendly and helpful everyone was very easy to deal with

 location first and foremost lovely gardens 
 very good hotel professional people s and very well organized unfortunately the fitness area is veeery small maybe this hotel with this kind of level can evaluate in the best future to invest something more in space for this area sauna was not available but o k i can accept this in summer period i hope this will not hapen during winter nothing more check always the price sometimes without promotion is not acceptable for this kind of structure i will pay for this not more than  p more than this price became not anymore competitive with similar hotel with same level
 clean comfy beds beautiful gardens excellent helpful staff 
 the staff were all so professional and friendly they really made the entire visit special and went out of their way to accommodate every inquiry or request we made the hotel itself was clean and the location to get on the earl s court tube was really convenient for all of our planned excursions i would totally recommend the k k hotel george 
 small but modern and well furnished room nice linens and a superior small bathroom 
 very comfortable bed with two kind of pillows one higher and one lower that suit different need in our family the hotel has a inside garden beautiful english style where you feel relax with a glass of beer it s very close to the earl s court station but still loated on a quite street you can keep the window open while you sleep during the night we like this hotel

 the location was excellent  mins from tube and walkable to several locations kensington palace albert hall knightsbridge etc if you re reasonably mobile we received a complimentary upgrade on the room bed was lovely and comfortable hotel was lovely staff friendly and attentive as is just off main road nice and quiet can t review facilities as we spent all day and night out in the city but what we saw and read it had all you need i always judge things on whether you d return and in this case yes i would you ll probably be able to get cheaper elsewhere but when you walk in you will realise why lovely hotel for a special occasion 
 we had gluten free breakfast they had separate toaster for gluten free breads but i can not recommend the breakfast or eating there at all for people who need to follow strict gluten free diet otherwise i can not complain great full wide ranging and diverse breakfast i just could not eat it still for sure i could stay there for another time and bring my husband for the breakfast enough for a big man it was great to have opportunity to print out your boarding passes after on line check in before leaving the hotel 
 friendly stuff clean location
 perfect location close to all transports nice and clean hotel friendly staff and a really nice garden the area was nice and quiet

 the hotel is incredibly handy to earl s court station we loved using the garden at the rear of the hotel plus its quiet location such a bonus for enjoying a quiet g t at the end of each hectic day in london we ate breakfast daily throughout our stay in the hotel s restaurant and the freshness food quality and choices were excellent being exhausted one night we ate dinner also in the restaurant where we chose from a limited but ample menu must mention that we had initial fears of noise from the elevator adjacent to which our room was located there was no need to worry as we never heard a sound from it amazing we ll be using this hotel again as it suited us so well 
 excellent location you have the access to earl s court underground within  minutes walk district and piccadilly lines take you to most of the sites you possibly need to go especially heathrow without any transfer many stores and restaurants around but the hotel is situated in a quiet quarter 
 house keeping quality and service very good even folded our clothes breakfast was unbelievable you even had stewed prunes first floor room was clean comfortable and very quiet loved the morning newspapers and availability of little lounge for afterdinner coffee and drinks liked the breakfast being made available with room price obtaining a cab at desk was very quick and their services the cab was quality also would consider staying here again 
 although the rooms are small they are comfortable and cozy and we found the hotel to be a great spot to rest and relax after running around the city breakfast was included making the price a little more reasonable than many hotels in this very expensive city 
 i love everything about this hotel it s in a perfect location round the corner from the tube but in a quiet street the breakfast caters for all tastes and is plentiful and delicious the rooms and beds are comfortable and very clean the staff can t do enough for you the whole feel of the hotel is up to and excelling in some cases the standard of an expensive west end hotel but with a cosy feel to it it s my favourite hotel in london and i ve stayed in quite a few 
 this is the second time i stay in this hotel it s clean and bed is calling my comfortable also the vote is near by earls court underground station and the street is full of restaurants coffee shops and supermarkets

 this hotel was a great value near the tube station in earl s court it was one of the few places in london that offered three twin beds in one room which was perfect for us since we were traveling with our daughter it was very clean and charming with comfortable beds and in a lovely quiet neighborhood proximate to transportation to everything there was a nice little lounge bar in the lobby that we stopped into every night after our touring 
 staff are well mannered and provide high standards of service breakfast buffet is first rate easy access to rest of london esp old brompton road and knotting hill 
 location is very useful for heathrow as taking the tube is safer than taxi if you don t want to miss your flight the place is very clean room size is fine and staff is very good 
 great location easy transportation to everything walking distance to restaurants and grocery stores room was very quiet and comfortable
 the breakfast selections were plentiful and and the attention to service was appreciated we especially liked the orderly way seating at breakfast was handled great taxi service was provided when requested 
 the beds and decor were nice it was an easy walk from the tube station and there were plenty of food establishments still open around it late at night we chose this hotel because three adults could stay in the one room in three separate beds which is a rare thing to find in accommodation extra pillows and a toothbrush set were brought promptly on request 
 we had a fantastic stay at the k k george very easy access to earls court tube which goes straight to heathrow as well as being a great start to explore london easily quiet street just behind the main shops and a lovely garden to have an evening drink in room was very comfortable and well serviced breakfast had lots of choice really a lovely base for a holiday in london

 we had a lovely stay at k k the staff was wonderful and so thoughtful when we arrived at   am after travelling all evening they offered the use of the wellness center to take showers amazing fluffy towels and freshen up before we headed out for a day of sightseeing since we would not be able to check in until pm that really saved the day and we had an amazing day in london

 the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was lovely all very clean 
 the bed was definitely extra comfy slept like a baby the staff was friendly and helpful the printing center was also very convenient 
 unlike the small hotels around this area this one is large and well organized the location is great which is only  munites walk from earl s court underground station which means it is in a quiet street but also is so easy to get food around the room is comparatively large considering the size of the hotel rooms in london it only takes about  munites going from heathrow airport to the hotel and is very suitable for people with large suitcases and arrive in london not very early i will definitely prefer this hotel next time

 great location just round the corner from earls court station easy access to all main attractions comfy room breakfast excellent choice staff very friendly would definately stay again on our next trip to london

 my go to place when in london this was my th stay great location within walking distance from earl s court underground station piccadilly line from heathrow staff is friendly rooms are up to date and clean 
 we loved the buffet breakfast and that the staff was so quick to provide us with breakfast bags when we left the hotel to go on tours very quick responses to opening the windows and unlocking door when we inadvertently left key in room also appreciated setting up taxi to go to airport 
 put us next to a smoking room and two of us asmathic staff were so rude when we brought it up they eventually moved us to a new room which was a massive downgrade and one of us had to sleep on a camp bed no apology was offered

 often the reality is different from the website but in the case of hotel george the photos really did portray reality i could not have been happier with every aspect of the hotel i chose this hotel because the average review was amazing this was spot on it s not a luxury hotel but it is a very stylish comfortable hotel that offered interesting little corners like the bar downstairs loved sitting in there before dinner just a great welcoming stylish elegant hotel where everything just worked who could want for more

 location
 excellent location for the price less than  mins walking to earl s court underground station which has a direct train to the airport on the piccadilly line good breakfast
 the staff were friendly the meal was nice could not use front entrance like everyone else had to use underground car park and go up hill  metres and down  metres down its a accident waiting to happen 
 its central location its proximity to metro station  min walk to earl s court underground station free internet delicious and varied food for breakfast and most importantly the really friendly and helpful staff members were the plus sides
 everything a boutique hotel should be well located on a quiet side street  minute walk to earls court station tasteful design throughout with great thought to efficency of design really impressive my single room was quite small but well laid out i will go back liked it the best of  hotels i ve stayed in london 
 staff were indifferent and sullen i was given the impression the guests there were an inconvenience i left two personal items behind after checking out and after ringing on  seperate occasions speaking to several staff members and emailing supposed head of housekeeping i got nowhere not once did anyone ring me back even after promising everytime they would and i never heard from them about my items ever they also gave me a  year old folding cot bed with a  mattress to sleep on for  nights i would have thought  plus for  nights would have afforded me a bed yes i complained and they relented eventually although the location is fantasticly placed i would never ever recommend this hotel to anyone in fact stay well away 
 hotel staff very helpful hotel was spotlessly clean well maintained
 very convenient location great breakfast friendly staff lovely atmosphere very comfortable beds
 staff was really kind and the facilities overall were really clean 
 bar area and reception good
 we love everything about the hotel george the location the facilities the staff and as this was our th stay in  years couldn t stay last year due to illness or it would have been  i think that speaks for itself 
 on this occasion the room was larger than on my recent stay which made things more comfortable however the bathroom was tiny the d cor was ok perhaps functional is an apt description there was minimal noise from the street which is a blessing in such a highly populated area and the location adjacent to earls court station was ideal 
 i went to london to visit my niece who was studying in london this hotel was ideally located in earl s court close to her apartment and the tube station very nice hotel and staff nice selection of food at breakfast located in a very quiet neighborhood but just minutes from the shops and stores at earl s court 
 room was ok if a little small and this was a king executive tea coffee making facilities were missing but most importantly it was pretty quiet and comfortable i requested a room change from a shower to a bath which was accommodated 
 location was great lots of nice pubs and restaurants nearby very close to underground easy to get to from heathrow excellent bed 
 very quiet area nice to have a room with access to the garden i like the fact that it is a small hotel plus i like the fact that it was a shower cubicle rather than over the bath shower 
 excellent location close to station location has parking which is very important
 location staff and cleanliness 
 great breakfast all the usual items just higher quality plus cava and nice touches like austrian apple strudel 
 good staff comfortable bed and pillows although we were a little disappointed at the size of the executive bedroom excellent choice of food at breakfast the bar area is a relaxing place to sit and have a drink with friends or just to sit quietly by the warm fire

 there was little or nothing wrong with this excellent hotel our room was very comfortable and a good size for a london hotel it was clean tidy and well equipped the staff were first class they were polite helpful and did it all with a smile which meant a lot the breakfast menu was comprehensive and of good quality we will certainly pay a return visit

 the location was excellent and within a decent walking distance from the underground tube we also went to a show and the hotel is on the edge of the theater district there were also many restaurants and shops nearby and while it was in a busy area the inside of the hotel itself was very quiet the bed was comfortable and the shower was nice the staff was also very helpful we arrived during some kind of system outage but they got us checked in and then let us know the next day that we could come back and check in properly they also got us taxis rather quickly when we needed them 
 we were offered an upgrade for a small supplement to a junior suite as part of that you get access to the club lounge the room was lovely looked as new comfy bed very clean and the club lounge is such a nice extra as it gives you somehwere to sit they have board games finger food breakfast foods and drinks alcoholic non alcoholic available hrs

 very clean large rooms with high value toiletries extremely comfortable bed and pillows friendly staff 
 this is without question one of london finest hotels i have never slept that well in a very very longtime and i love the duck amazing reception and great facilities 
 great location room was outstanding beds were so clean and comfortable bathroom had a big deep bath and a fantastic shower we would recommend this hotel to everybody 
 the hotel gave us a complimentary upgrade to a suite which was fantastic the room and bed were extremely comfortable excellent personalised service food was excellent 
 the design facilities and location of the hotel wifi and also gym were quite convenient
 staff were lovely reception sent a card and a box of chocolates up for my birthday room service food was fantastic and nice cocktails served in the bar room wasn t the biggest but had everything we needed very clean and lovely bathroom too 
 the bathroom was light pleasant and very clean the wardrobe space was good and there were tea making facilities the bed was comfortable 
 the room was clean and comfortable bathroom was modern and spacious 
 just returned from a wonderful weekend at the apex temple court where to start from the amazing upgrade for my husbands th birthday to the personalised handwritten note and chocolates left for us in the room everything was perfect from the start the hotel is in a great location less than  minutes walk to covent garden and for location alone is great value i had chosen the hotel as we were attending the aldwych theatre and it was literally around the corner it s clean modern and our room was to die for with a balcony offering views of the london eye the apex offers so many extra touches with the free jelly beans pringles and of course the apex duck we had a great nespresso machine in our room and robes and slippers all added to make the perfect stay they really have thought about everything we have stayed in many hotels in london but would definately choose apex again 
 it was located in a cosy corner off the street 
 the staff were very accommodating it was mine and my partners anniversary and they did such an amazing job at making the room look lovely
 very nice hotel quiet setting within an inner courtyard terrace will be lovely in summer plus also very quiet i imagine very pleasant staff and good hotel bar i didn t use the restaurant neither for breakfast or evening so can t comment 
 beds were very comfy bathroom was fantastic and location was excellent 
 the location of the hotel is superb convenient and close to the centre yet tucked away in a quiet hidden away pocket 
 the staff were fantastic in the bar super friendly the shower and bath were fantastic 
 staff was very nice and interior decoration was stylish and warm good location to walk around london 
 nice bathroom with big shower and bath quiet if you get a room on the top floors 
 i spend the weekend in the apex hotel with my boyfriend and we had an an wonderful weekend the stuff from apex was so friendly and they made everything possible have a great birthday weekend in london for this thank you so much we will come back best regards theresa
 rooms are quiet beds are huge bathroom is spacious and shower is hot and powerful location is very good thames within walking distance temple area is beautiful note however that during weekends the atmosphere is different than during week days due to the fact that many shops most of the business centres and the criminal courts are closed which results in less people in the neighbourhoud 
 comfortable room which was very clean
 everything from the reception greeting of luca to leaving wth yet another warm vibe from reception the cleaning staff were polite and warm my standard room was spotless in terms of cleanliness an incredibly cosy bed a nice ambience to the room 
 very comfortable and clean room balcony was a little plus 
 alex hotel couldn t find our booking at first but it worked out that they had upgraded us to a junior suite which was amazing free rubber duck was a nice touch and did make us laugh 
 hotel was clean smart looking and great location as well as very professional the room was spacious and the bathroom with both separate shower and bath was a brilliant bonus our room was located right outside the lifts and we didnt hear anything also had to love the apex duck would definately recommend staying in an apex hotel 
 location would have been great
 room was a nice size and very quiet quite a long walk from reception along winding corridors but worth the walk when you got there we were in room  which was the very end room on a corridor and we never heard a thing 
 the hotel is in a quiet location right in the heart of london so it is within easy walking distance of most of the places we wished to visit we didn t experience the usual problem of banging doors and loud voices that seems to be the norm these days in big hotels maybe because we were right at the end of a corridor maybe because the walls and floors are well soundproofed so we managed to have a good undisturbed night s sleep there was very little traffic noise either it was lovely to be able to go to the local theatres and walk back to the hotel afterwards the novello is a about  minutes walk away i loved the idea of the little duck it made it feel more personal and now sits in my bathroom at home the room we had was a good size the bed was extremely comfortable and the room was spotlessly clean a bath robe and slippers were provided as well as the usual toiletries

 excellent centre base for sight seeing would definitely stay here again worth mentioning if you have a special occasion like a birthday or anniversary while staying perfect  out of  from us

 i booked this for my parents for their golden wedding anniversary trip to london with another couple all four said how fantastic their stay was they commented in particular about how friendly and helpful the staff were and how impressed they were with their room and the hotel facilities 
 we were a party of ten adults booked for a special friends birthday the staff upgraded the birthday girl s room and had it decorated with balloons and banners that friends had mailed down this made a very special birthday a very memorable weekend staff at the hotel were very obliging and couldn t do enough for us all 
 the hotel is clean and well located between both temple and chancery lane tube stations but not exactly that close to them the room size is very good clean and you ll find everything you need the bed is more for the very soft kind i personally would prefer them to be neither soft nor hard staff is efficient and very kind 
 what a superb hotel the room we had was beautiful and we had a great view of the london eye as it was my boyfriends th birthday they also provided a complimentary cake everything we wanted to get to was in walking distance which meant traveling round even late at night was easy

 great location for all major landmarks so much so we walked to most from westminster to tower bridge staff very attentive responsive free upgrade on arrival enjoyed the whole experience so much we added another day to our visit highly recommended 
 we loved the fact that our room had a balcony have stayed in many hotels in london before and never had this luxury at what was a sensible price

 they transfer me to the park grand london kensington due to maintance work at the park grand london paddington they offer me a free ride to kensington a soft drink while im i watting the taxi and includ the breakfast in my stay which that im not applied for it park grand london kensington newer and bigger than park grand london paddington underground station  mins walk people at reception and generally everyone i interacted with was super friendly and helpful which makes a difference the handy phone that comes with the room the bathroom is clean with all required supplies there is a microwave and small separate room for cloths and iron 
 this is my second time staying at this hotel the first time i was on business this time it was for mini holiday the bed is very comfortable the room and bathroom very clean and spacious the location is very convenient very good selection at breakfast 
 very handy location to paddington station and heathrow express and in the pretty paddington area this hotel is clean and comfortable if a little dated the staff are wonderful thank you and the english breakfast was excellent not a fancy and extensive breakfast buffet but a tasty and well cooked meal equally food on the room service menu was tasty and fresh good indian and european cuisine 
 the room was small but we knew that before arrival i just didn t think that paying an extra  for a room that i wasn t going to spend much time in warranted it the wardrobe didn t mark sense as it was so thin you couldn t actually hang anything in it the hairdryer was in the wardrobe and the mirror on the back of the door that didn t open wide enough to look in to blow dry your hair parking was a nightmare as you have to park  minutes away and trudge back with your luggage this wasn t mentioned before booking i wish the hotel would have had a link to booking which is under waitrose and was  for two night the price wasn t that bad it was just the nightmare of walking back and forth with luggage the location was good close to paddington and lancaster gate we walked to oxford street as it was so close and the weather was fab 
 the free breakfast every morning that came with the stay the staff in the restaurant were wonderful 
 hyde park and public transport are in close proximity we used bayswater station everyday staff is really helpful supported us in printing boarding passes the pub across the street is great the room is small but probably good for value because of price and location 
 the drinks at the bar were very reasonably priced
 great transport system nearby especially from the airport lhr customer service is excellent
 location shower
 good aircon comfy bed brilliant shower
 good shower and toiletries air conditioning big window and pleasant outlook towels and sheets clean and good quality apples available at reception iron available from reception desk 
 good location staff was good 
 location not too bad access to tube and rail confusing with another hotel in group within close proximity went to book into wrong hotel interior bit tired and then we were in the room at the top of the building so bit dark bathroom facilities strange with wet room set up but not ideal with curtain and door so close 
 the space is good for a family of  the bathroom is clean with all required supplies there is a microwave and small separate room for cloths and iron 
 the hotel location is excellent it is super close to the paddington train and tube stations it is near to places to eat food stores and pharmacy you walk three streets south and you are next to the hyde park kensington gardens gate i had breakfast at their restaurant two days in a row and the food was good and a good selection of items my room did not have an iron and ironing board in it but it was made available by the staff right away 
 very friendly helpful staff room was cleaned well beautiful building in a quiet area of paddington with good facilities nearby
 the room was very modern and clean staff were also very friendly and made our stay extra special 
 convenient location very clean and modern good coffee helpful staff
 the location was perfect
 i expected a budget room to be small but this really was v small cramped not enough space for suitcase shower area adequate hidden wardrobe drop down desk useful bed however very comfortable indeed staff exceptionally helpful which made up for the minute sized room 
 rooms way to small bathrooms also small 
 quiet pleasant location a few minutes walk from paddington station good sized room and bathroom 
 a great hotel in a beautiful old terrace building we had a club room which was modern and spacious with large windows bed was amazingly comfortable walking distance to paddngton station and heathrow express 
 very helpful and accomodating staff lovely to have a valet to carry my bag to and from my room and get me a cab the concierge desk was very helpful was given free breakfast each day after having to be moved to their sister hotel just a short distance down the street due to a broken boiler in my booked hotel 
 short walk from kensington gardens and paddington station lots of coffee shops and restaurants in the vicinity helpful friendly staff at reception especially the lady from armenia was first put into a small rooftop room but then given a bigger room on lower floor with huge ceilings 
 good location within  minutes walk of paddington quiet location with great facilities and pleasant staff easy access to travel points and only  minutes from kensington gardens 
 i booked a triple room the room is quiet large and has a balcony the location is really nice near the paddinton station just about  minutes walk and hyde park the staff are very very friendly and they will try to meet all your need i order two room services and the food is really delicious breakfast is also very nice i will definitely choose this hotel again when i go to london next time 
 the friendliness of the staff was exceptional they wanted our visit to be the best and my daughter who was  months pregnant received special treatment breakfast was very good 
 the bed is super comfortable i could close the curtains and make it very dark make tea in the morning in teapot there and of course it is very clean 
 a compact but well furnished room with a very comfortable bed good lights and an excellent shower 
 a nice hotel in a very convenient location very clean people at reception and generally everyone i interacted with was super friendly and helpful which makes a difference i also appreciated the welcome plate of fruits as well as the handy phone that comes with the room very convenient especially when your own phone is behaving weird in other countries all this made up for the price which i initally thought a bit too much and i still booked an offer that was supposed to be largely discounted  a night for a compact room if i paid the full amount i would think it is overpriced but i guess that s london in the summer 
 the club room is comfortable for  clean and bright the room seems to be newly furbished the toilet is spacious too 
 omg what a tiny tiny room you could not walk around the bed without walking sideways no room for anything no barfridge appalling really when they tout themselves as being boutique 
 the staff were friendly and polite the location was ideal for commuting in and out of the centre of london easily there were ample places to go for a meal within walking distance 
 the hotel was close to the underground and some nice resturants
 the rooms have been renovated to look quite nice and are representative of the photos but they re not at all functional to stay in they ve placed extra furniture items in the room in an attempt to correct this but that just makes the spaces cluttered and not all of the additional items are functional either i e additional robe placed in dark entrance mostly filled up by the ironing board hard to see into damp smell emanating from it and makes accessing room awkward i ended up checking out after one night as i was there for  days and had work commitments so ease of use with the room was important to me 
 the room was huge and very quiet
 a mostly very young staff were very helpful and added to the stay 
 staff in restaurant were very helpful at breakfast with gluten free diet selection of food was very good 
 friendly staff and easy to walk to the tube clean rooms
 we actually stayed at grand royal hyde park as there was a problem with the boiler at paddington one to make up for transfer they gave us free drinks while we waited for the taxi they gave us and gave us free breakfasts at the hyde park it was a beautiful hotel ornate turned wood stained glass windows beautiful painted ceilings like being in rome the staff were polite happy to help and give us information looked after our bag on checkout day until we left london at pm breakfast was in a beautiful large room plentiful full cooked or continental fresh croissants anything you could possibly want the room was very comfortable complete with kettle and fridge and wardrobe view wasn t great overlooked an alley but it was light and quiet no street noise all manner of shops and cafes and the tube just around the corner and hyde park  metres away i would definitely recommend this to others 
 paddington is a beautiful suburb and unbelievably quiet for london rooms are a reasonable size for london and the window could actually be opened which makes a nice change complimentary fruit water was also a nice touch definitely would return to this hotel
 the location of the hotel was brilliant the area felt safe and there were shops and cafes with friendly staff hyde parks a stones throw away was perfect and a short power walk to oxford street instead of public transport the hotel was accessible friendly staff and had good amenities 
 location of the propert was fantastic and near the tube stations staff was fantastic and even the breakfast seemed over staffed rooms are modern clean and even presented a complimentary coffee as we waited for our room luxurious and well price for central london 
 very comfortable room and excellent staff they welcomed us at the hotel with smiles and upgraded our room to a club room for the night for no extra money we ordered room service and the food was absolutely amazing with no exceptions we had salad soup and two main courses all of which we couldnt finish because of the plentiful portions it was not expensive either i am definitely planning on staying at this hotel again or one of others in their chain of hotels theres plenty of room to keep clothes in built in closets and the shower is great as well overall an excellent and cozy experience 
 modern room good location helpful staff 
 i am very fond of bayswater location breakfast was ok and serving and cleaning tables was quick 
 the hotel offered guest a cell wifi mobile app with map and gps 
 everything had a nice feel to it the staff were friendly and were always smiling and laughing 
 the porter staff were very friendly the receptionists didn t seem to care 
 the hotel is in walking distance from paddington station and so to heathrow that s my reason for using this hotel 
 the hotel was perfect for a short stay in the heart of london very conveniently located for paddington station and the heathrow express highly recommended 
 location is nice and surrounding is also pretty comfortable to find aynthing
 the property is conveniently located near paddington station it was very easy to get to the airport by heathrow express 
 when we arrived at the hotel we were told that there were problems with the boiler so we would have to stay in another hotel of the chain london grand paddington court we were offered a complimentary breakfast for noth days the following review is of the hotel where we ended up staying which was the london grand paddington court instead of the twin beds our room had a double everything else was as advertised good shower tea and coffee ironing facilites we did enjoy our stay but having to share a bed was an inconvience the breakfast was delicious 
 really good location very friendly staff and very helpful we were meeting our son whose birthday it had been recently and we wanted to surprise him with a cake and candles we asked if we could do this in the hotel bar and they not only agreed but also whisked the cake away lit the candles and brought it out to surprise him once we were seated in the bar excellent 
 the location was great being close to paddington station the rooms are really nice and very comfortable 
 convenient location and friendly staff
 breakfast was delicious the staff were so attentive to our needs the heated floor was divine 
 the staff were really friendly and welcoming 
 the location close to paddington
 bed was comfortable 
 the bed is comfurtable room is quite large compared to other hotels location is amazing between paddington hyde park and queensway
 the room had a fridge which is so handy with a nice bottle of cold water waiting for me when i arrived also a plate of fruit was delivered to my room before i had even got there left luggage was also available which is so handy there is a free mobile phone in the room where you can browse the internet and make free calls from i think its called ihandy staff were courteous and helpful great location  min walk to paddington station and about half an hour to oxford st will be using this hotel again customer satisfaction stands out as a priority in this hotel 
 it was clean and staff were friendly and very central nice to have complimentary fruit and water in the room no wine as someone else mentioned 
 the bed is the best i have ever slept on the buffet breakfast was very accommodating tasty and value for money 
 the staff were very helpful the room was big and english breakfast was lovely
 size of room and bathroom staff porters excellent kettle 
 great location walking distance from paddington station and lots of dining options nearby safe and secure area few mins walk to hop on hop off busses hyde park is  mins walk away staff were all helpful 
 added in breakfast and transport to compensate for boiler issues
 the location was wonderful although our cab driver had a hard time finding it the bed was pretty hard other than that it was great loved the heated bathroom floor 
 good value and central location
 location to train station
 bed was nice and comfortable location excellent within mins walk of  tube stations lancaster gate bayswater and paddington and absolutely value for money will definitely be back soon good and helpful staff especially andrea at the reception 
 room was cozy as advertised meaning not enough room to walk around the bed i m not complaining it was a great price on the weekend of the london marathon 
 quiet location very close to paddington station and hyde park our room was comfortable and had tea coffee making facilities staff were helpful i would stay here again 
 the hotel was well situated for a visit to the center of london and was very comfortable i believe the hotel has had a refurb because the rooms are somewhat like a spaceship with wooden panels hiding the walls but it works the staff were friendly its a hotel for visitng a city where the room is to relax and sleep but the hotel offers little else other than a coffee and thats what we wanted 
 our room was clean cosy and quiet excellent powerful shower and added bonus of under floor heating the breakfast buffet was amazing very polite and helpful staff we will definitely be returning on our next visit 
 arrived at the hotel to be informed that the boiler was broken so moved to the park hotel paddington court excellent hotel amazing staff room upgrade too 
 the staff tried to help not necessarily that they succeeded in that stay here only if you were desperate for a room in london more like for a bed only good for an urgent stay 
 location was really nice just  minutes away from paddington station good restaurants and shops are near by 
 convenient location friendly staff we were transferred to another room and offered complimentary breakfast due to some problems with hot water in the room we originally booked 
 location was good
 the bed was good heating and or air conditioning were easy to use

 park grand kessington is easy to go museums and parks 
 dinner menu was very reasonably priced great location for my need 
 good proximity to hyde park staff made sure my requests of soy milk for breakfast and a room with windows that open were met things i like white sheets comfy pillows great shower lovely window view not too hot in rooms dental pack big breakfast choice esp fresh fruit and friendly staff 
 room was clean great shower decent wifi request one of the rooms on the outside overlooking a little park  minute walk to paddington station

 cleanliness of the room and the fresh croissants 
 i have never stayed in this hotel before it was easy to get yourself lost in westminster borough and so had rang the hotel reception for directions and had the whole time to hold the phone on me till i have eventually have found the destination it made my life so much easier as i ve never been around in this part of london before when i walked in to the main entrance i was nicely greeted by the doorman and had immediately carried my luggage all the way to my room my club room was beautiful but the only disadvantage was it didn t had a big window as expected as shown on the gallery it didn t fuss me much though the cleanliness of the room was at such high standards and was very impressed with the size of the shower head as it was enormous i had no problem with the room and had provided me with a plateful of fresh fruit wrapped in clingfilm and two bottles of merlot never to late to drink on your arrival why not the best part of the hotel was the breakfast i didn t like the breakfast i absolutely loved it as it was the best breakfast ever everything was cooked to perfection nicely smoked the juices were freshly pressed and a big thank you to the chef for all of his cooking efforts the restaurant staff had welcomed me with a very cheery attitude and had made me felt at home they were so lovely and i felt very accomplished to half of those negative reviewers coming up with such sad enthusiastic comments think again because from my point of view this hotel deserves more than a four star well done to all and be prepared for my next visit xx
 shower is good breakfast is good wi fi is good and free window had good sound proofing 
 very good breakfast had gluten free bread and explained all the available food for my daughter we checked in earlier than expected which was facilitated with ease the lady in charge of the dining area was exceptionally welcoming and professional remembering us each morning great choice of newspapers and reading material 
 rooms could do with some attention throughout especially for such a premium london based hotel should spend some money on renovating other than that it was all smiles rooms service food was bang on

 location good lebanese restaurant nearby 
 the location
 great location with friendly staff rooms are clean and modern but small as usual in london hotels lots of different restaurants in the area such as lebanese malaysia indian italian malaysia pubs 
 located conveniently close to paddington and not too far from lancaster gate comfortable bed room size was really small as stated but ok for  days would visit again 
 excellent value for money we were upgraded to a suite free of charge so found ourselves in a very comfortable modern and exceptionally clean  suite for just over  staff were very helpful organising a cake for my partner s birthday and although we didn t eat at the hotel the indian food in the bar smelt delicious room service was very reasonably priced too 
 clean smart room with a comfortable mattress friendly staff and an excellent location

 close to paddington could easily walk to hyde park tube etc restaurants shops and great cafes for breakfast close by clean but tiny room everything you needed but cramped and my husband and i are small would be fine for a single traveler great wifi

 location and value for money
 great location near paddington very friendly staff good simple breakfast excellent value for the price 
 for the price paid   normal rate i thought this was a good value hotel plate of fruit was a nice touch as were the pack of jammy dodgers with the tea and coffee making facilities the room was smallish but well laid out i stayed for one night the location is great and if you re visiting london for the first time this hotel is easily accessible from the train station and tube at paddington

 excelllent view out to cleveland square quiet extremely helpful staff at all times of day and evening good furnishings of room  good magazine supply nice atmosphere in lounge bar above all the excellent room and its fittings mind the ingenuity of the designer in fitting so much into the space of  made it a very different experience than staying in one of the larger upgraded room suites of my last stay there both are fine just radically different 
 the staff were really friendly especially sara we would definitely come and stay here again because of her 
 great staff and value for money hotel was lovely although there were a few stains on the curtains this did not bother me that much however other guests may not be so forgiving 
 ideal location for paddington station and the parks and only a good walk to the west end weather permitting greeting from the reception was friendly and welcoming rooms were small but well appointed lack of bath in rooms was a little disappointing but shower was good no public space to relax apart from a sofa in reception and a very small bar we didn t eat breakfast but the food we saw looked very good the staff in all departments were polite knowledgeable and helpful as well as looking smart and sharp we as a family enjoyed our time here
 best value for money in a hotel in london within a walkable distance to oxford street the reception staff were excellent the boys were probably the best in uk as they handled our luggage all the way during check in checkout room is small but good 
 i like the quality of service room decoration staff was friendly moreover they provided me storage option which was very comfortable specially if you have trains to heathrow overall i had a great experience staying there

 we stayed here before and found the location to be excellent for getting about central london central line tube and bus stop only a   min walk and plenty of places to eat and drink in all directions considering the location it is pretty quiet at night this time we opted for a club room which was pretty large and well worth the relatively small extra cost we have stayed in lots of places in london but will definitely stay here again 
 i enjoyed my time in the hotel everything were perfect and great breakfast was very well the staff very kindly especially tina and diana i will stay more and more in that hotel again

 the hotel was lovely clean modern and comfortable despite a problem with the water they moved us to their sister hotel which was only a stones throw away and gave us complimentary breakfast for the entire stay to say sorry we also had our rooms upgraded and following another misunderstanding with the room booking the staff could not do enough for us to make it right the customer service was superb during our stay our pregnant friend was really ill and the hotel manager lizzie personally cared for her and the hotel driver escorted her to back and to to the nearest hospital the customer service here was first class and i would highly recommend it i can t thank them enough for how well they looked after us i would defo stay here again

 fantastic weekend with my partner we would definitely stay here again location was excellent and couldn t have asked for a better area to stay in was so close to the metro and all the shops bars and restaurants room was lovely and cosey and very modern with a classy edge to the facility 
 good location really good breakfast maybe the best i ever had in paris in a confortable and stylish setting everything you need is provided on site you can literally arrive with your hands in your pockets helpfull and attentive staff 
 i asked to be downgraded because i was paying for a balcony room while i couldn t enjoy the balcony instead they upgraded me with the biggest room in the hotel for the same rate 
 the room has everything inside as a full package
 excellent breakfast comfortable bed stayed in a room with a balcony room  highly recommend this room and hotel short walk to metro and arc de triumph 
 mon hotel is a charming boutique hotel located near champs elysees in a little street coming from l avenue des grand armees near the bus direct stop airport shuttle the metro station argentine line  is just  min away and it can lead you everywhere in town very nice caf s and restaurants near by though not the most glamourous neighborhood you can find in paris the mini market le marche d etoile offers fresh fruits and all the basic things one might need the street is very quiet and the hotel is located in a very nice classical building the service at the reception is great loved it the staff is really helpful the room is so confy specially the bed air conditioning works great as well as the wifi to end up the best features every room has a smartphone where you can navigate freely in and out of the hotel amazing right and before your stay the hotel sends you an email asking for your guest needs explaining how to get there nearby restaurants and attractions never experienced this kind of service before i was really wowed highly recommended 
 room was lovely and extremelly quiet especially after pm you can keep you window wide open and wont hear a sound they gave us a smartphone for free to use while we stay there was free g internet and free calls over the europe and north america it helped alot to keep in touch with a family and dont get lost in paris staff was really nice stayed proffessional even after asking some silly questions like how the light turns on because we didnt knew that you need your room card to turn it on it is litterally minutes from arc de triopmhe which lights up wounderfully at the night and even you can pay  euro to get on top of it and you can see a paris from there its absolutely beutiful metro station is nearby which speeded up our travel instead of walking we took metro a ticket is about euro but it can bring you anywhere really nice location highly recommended 
 the hotel brings a high style of modernity and glamour the staff is always ready to help in anything and the amazing location between the turistic and business area in paris 
 location is excellent and quite easy accessible for tourists travelling by car with parking in the vicinity staff diligent and responsive rooms are well equipped and they have a nice hotel bar

 amazing victorianlandmark hotel in the heart of the city with one of the kindest and most attentive staffs i have encountered 
 hotel location near the city centre and transportation free wifi with good signal room comfort coffee tea and cookies courtesy 
 the resection and outside of the building were beautiful and the staff were polite and very helpful 
 location very good nice architecture good staff 
 location excellent tube round the corner and easy walk to covent garden staff were friendly and helpful 
 the location is great just near russel sq station 
 the location was superb and the staff friendly and helpful there are improvements currently underway but it had little impact we had a with no view and noise from the air conditioning but that was probably a reflection on the price we paid 
 room was clean hotel has lots of character breakfast was good lots of selection left my smartphone in room on check out i was at airport before i noticed that it was missing staff found the phone and sent it to me thank you miles for your concern and prompt action 
 hotel russell is a beautiful historic hotel with amazing public rooms but also very attractive comfortable guest rooms we ll be back 
 great looking hotel both inside and out
 all staff especially miles on reception were professional and friendly and the rooms were well kept lounge and bar arrears felt comfortable and relaxing 
 enjoyed room service twice very quick and delicious food comfy bed lovely breakfast
 awesome historic building conveniently located next to the underground staff specifically miles was incredibly friendly and made our stay an experience 
 the location of the hotel is amazing you are easy walking distance to all of the london attractions and to the city the old doorman has been here for years a welcoming face for sure 
 staff are extremely friendly and obliging aircon in my room didn t work so they immediately arranged a move and upgrade location is brilliant free wifi breakfast was good and convenient a great place to stay 
 door staff excellent reception staff excellent i asked for a quiet room and that was what i was given astonishing most london hotels would have ignored my request 
 beautiful building great location and really helpful staff 
 plenty of choice for breakfast with very nice tea and coffee full english and continental available with fresh croissants and pastries also location was perfect as it was very close to tube station but also within walking distance of the major shops and attractions and opposite russell square gardens staff were very pleasant and helpful 
 the hotel was clean and the room was well knitted out shower brilliant the staff were lovely 
 breakfast was not fresh potatoes the standard fried triangles were stale and over fried pastries were not fresh and gave off a stale taste i m comparing the russell hotel breakfast buffet to that at the euston hilton hotel at upper woburn which was excellent 
 fabulous service gorgeous old world charm modem spacious room loved having such a helpful doorman every day after a busy day of sightseeing how wonderful to be greeted by cold water infused with fresh fruit at the reception counter 
 we generally loved this hotel we d passed it and admired its statuesque grandeur when we d been in bloomsbury before so we thought we d try staying there the location is excellent so close to a tube stop that even with baggage getting in from heathrow was do able the hotel s victorian style has been maintained so noticing the dragon sculpture on the staircase a twin to the one lost on the titanic and other unique period features the staircase itself the chandelier etc was a delight every time we left our room the staff was very helpful 
 the hotel russell is a rare survivor of a bygone era few hotels today can match the historical opulence of the russell hotel it is worth a visit if only to have a drink at the bar 
 location perfect and delightful area not too busy lovely park opposite nice restaurants and bars in the area character of hotel is beautiful with lovely marble and tiled features staff polite and helpful our room was large with nice bathroom would definitely stay there again 
 this is a large classic hotel interior by the man who did the decorating of the titanic located very close to the tube makes it great for getting around room much larger than most in london right across street from park near british museum 
 great central location and a monument to victorian grandeur on the architecture of the hotel 
 the staff were particularly friendly and helpful it was our th wedding anniversary which came out in conversation when we checked in we were surprised and delighted to find a card a bottle of champagne and  delicious cakes beautifully presented in our room on the day this was a very thoughtful and kind gesture which would encourage us to pay a return visit 
 staff were really friendly and they catered to all our needs everything was very clean our requests were all fulfilled which made this an extra special stay for a birthday i couldn t fault a single thing 
 great location for what we needed beautiful exterior and lobby and bar area
 hotel russell is my preferred hotel in london the piccadilly line takes you from the airport directly to the hotel russell station and then you are in the central part of london close to the british museum and many historic sites the hotel itself is historic and charming and is undergoing renovations the only downside is the lack of airconditioning the room did have a fan 
 very clean and comfortable good location breakfast was very good fresh food 
 the location was good and it is easy to get to the main attractions in london from there 
 good clean room which reflects what was promised on the photos take note not all rooms have the old grand baths 
 great location friendly staff lovely room although a bit on the small side for a twin room very lovely building with real character gorgeous stair case and chandelier 
 the reception staff were very friendly and helpful and made our stay work like clockwork likewise the building works had no negative impact on our stay the hotel is well located for both euston and st pancras station and of course the british museum 
 beds were comfortable room was adequate for our needs
 beautiful hotel and in a good location for the eurostar room was a good size located on the top floor overlooking the park staff were friendly and helpful
 comfortable bed and great location friendly staff 
 the hotel was designed by the person who designed the titanic and the downstairs and architecture was incredibly grand the rooms and bathrooms were pretty small bernard the concierge was excellent 
 the building is beautiful and the staff were helpful and friendly euston station is a  minute walk away and oxford st shopping close by 
 rooms small compared to previous stays but comfortable with plenty of amenities we did move one room as there was no door chain and air conditioner very noisy staff are incredibly helpful and pleasant concierge had the doorman walk our luggage to the underground and a restaurant designed by the designer of the titanic 
 i highly recommend this hotel excellent value for money in central london the architecture and the decor is remarkable my room was spacious with a high ceiling and large bay windows and the bed was very comfortable in addition to that the customer service was superb from the waiters to the hotel manager and it was great to see the receptionist cohen who has the perfect combination of impeccable manners with friendly professionalism 
 an incredibly comfortable bed in a really well appointed room and cohen the receptionist was highly professional friendly and polite excellent hotel 
 the hotel is clean the staff is very friendly the room was relatively big so i had space to move around the staff is super friendly and the location is perfect the tube is extremely close and while you usually have to switch trains the fact that the station is small and easy to get around is a big bonus for example you might think that being close to kings cross is a better location but that station is huge and just to get in and out of it is at least  minutes and that s if you get the exit right switching trains is very easy and convenient and in my opinion should not be taking into consideration when choosing a location it s also located in front of russel square park which is very nice 
 reception staff were very helpful breakfast was good 
 the location
 the location from st pancras was perfect we walked from the station to the hotel in less than  minutes great access to the tube 
 good location 
 location is amazing for travel from heathrow and to visit most sites in london very near a tube station on one of the best tube lines coffee shops beside the hotel 
 excellent breakfast comfortable room wonderful wide staircase

 very interesting decor good location great little restaurant around the corner 
 always excellent reception staff who try hard to offer quiet rooms i always feel welcome and that s why i return it s very good value for the quality
 it is a beautiful old hotel a bit worn down but with distinct charm 
 excellent desk and concierge service gracious and friendly and provided good service location is right at the picadilly tube line and easy walking to the circle line i took the picadilly tube to heathrow and avoided traffic to get there i rolled my suitcase around the corner took the lift to the platform and didn t have to move again until reaching heathrow ok one short stairway that s convenient 
 perfect location for our morning spent at the british museum 
 great location tube station around corner plenty of restaurants in nearby streets concierge staff helpful in tracking down an international courier parcel grandiose decor inside

 this is a very high grade hotel with splendid rooms friendly staff and a good splash of luxury 
 close location to tube station 
 it is a begging xx century building with very comfortable and warm rooms the building was conceived by the same architect of the titanic elegant restaurant 
 not much a very very loud heating system which banged as though some one was hitting the door every  minutes throughout the night requested a room change for the next one to be even lower like a turbo engine starting directly over the top of the bed also given the wrong room number on arrival 
 amazing exterior
 staff were very helpful and nice to deal with 
 overall great price for central london some minor issues with the shower sink but very minor really not impeccably clean but not what i d call dirty either windows could use a cleaning room is small but plenty big for just me and again great price for central london staff was friendly and having the hotel bar open until a is great considering every other pub closes at p or midnight plenty of food options and pubs nearby and the picadilly line is one block away i stayed here  nights on business vacation and would definitely stay again for the price i paid

 we stayed here the first time and had a great experience great room the room service order got screwed up but we weren t to bothered awesome location we liked it so much we came back a few days later and it was terrible i think we must have been upgraded to a nicer room the first time without being told so the second time when they offered us an upgraded room we declined thinking it would be the same as before it sure wasn t the room stunk had a bank of about  aircon units outside the window the air con in the room didn t work so we had to have the windows open in the middle of winter to keen it cool the bathroom was filthy and the bed extremely uncomfortable and squeaky would never stay in this rooms again but the upgraded rooms are really good they also screwed up our room service order the second time and the operator didn t know what a hashbrown was even though it was on the menu

 very easy to walk to oxford street goodge street restaurants st pals and the old bailey and just  minutes walk from euston 
 the hotel itself location staff were all great i have travelled extensively and stayed in many hotels the public areas in this hotel are very impressive 
 staff were great and the lobby area and bar were great
 it is a spacious hotel and generlly clean it has a good bar the concierge is good 
 very friendly staff good sized room good location clean building and room good value for the money being in london and right by tube station
 the bed was comfortable
 i did ask for a slightly earlier check in  instead of standard pm as i had just travelled from australia they had not received this request i only had to wait for one hour instead of two this was greatly appreciated lovely bathroom for a small room 
 i had wanted to stay here ever since i saw the exterior two years ago the internet price came down just before my august trip so i grabbed it the hotel did not disappoint it was better than i had hoped the room staff were efficient and sweet the desk staff helpful the door staff adequate not very friendly actually the bar excellent i didn t try the restaurant the room was well appointed and i loved the kettle and the provided tea sugar shortbread the shower directions were hilariously confusing but i got the thing to work just fine excellent i will hope to stay there again 
 hotel location has great access to tube lines and the british museum is an easy five minute walk cafe nero is kitty corner for delicious coffee makes for an inexpensive continental breakfast hotel bar is a quiet comfortable spot for a pre post dinner cocktail and be sure to rub the brass dragon located on the second floor in the stair well it s mate is at the bottom of the atlantic aboard the titanic

 hotel russell is a lovely old hotel with a wonderful location minutes to the british museum and with the tube right around the corner the standard double was fine clean comfortable and roomy enough for our week in london my wife especially appreciated the deep tub in the large bathroom 
 location was great and for a the room for single in central london it was very comfortable 
 beautifully hotel nice bar and nice rooms the staff is very friendly
 the placement of the hotel is perfect 
  seconds from tube station 
 bed lovely and comfy breakfast really good staff reception bar waiter all really great 
 the location suited us very well the staff were very friendly 
 larger room than expected and with fabulous disabled facilities in wetroom comfortable bed and very quiet so had good nights sleep
 went to extra effort knowing it was my wife s birthday gifts etc great location from euston and to covent gdn and theatre breakfast was exceptional
 the room is comfortable with air conditioner that many of the hotels in london do not have bathroom is clean the heating rail for bath towel is very thoughtful hotel staff are polite and helpful 
 the location was great for our trip we wanted to visit lings college london on the strand theatre land and oxford street they were all within walking dustance 
 loved the historic character of the building it was well maintained the room was comfortable if a bit small bathroom was large room service was good good location and great value for the price 
 decor a bit gloomy but otherwise perfectly serviceable great location 
 the staff couldn t have done more for us friendly and kind with little extras that made our stay all the nicer grand look a cozy room and a nice bar too really impressive and would definitely stay there again absolute bargain 
 location was excellent hotel was very clean and friendly breakfast was good value for money if booked in advance 
 fantastic location got a deal on room rate so made stay value for money would recommend as right next to shops and tube station walking distance from euston 
 such an excellent location  minute to a tube station so easy to get around comfortable quiet rooms with extremely helpful staff we will return again and again 
 comfort and location 
 the location and overall quality of the hotel has kept me coming back to it again and again for sheer convenience it is difficult to beat 
 lovely big room plenty of storage big bathroom clean and comfortable
 the entrance and outside of the hotel was amazing it is located a  minute walk away from euston and right outside a tube station staff were friendly and nice and the concierge desk took our luggage even after we had checked out so we didn t have to carry it all over london on our last day 
 the grand staircase it is absolutely stunning and all those only using the lift would probably not get to see it 
 good location staff helpful 
 room decor nice and clean external facade
 the location the ambience 
 beautiful traditional hotel loved being greeted and helped with luggage by concierge no queues when checking in or out hotel staff happy and helpful really nice bar area very comfortable for passing a couple of hours on a rainy day only down side bath plug broken so water drained out while trying to have a bath and very slippy even with bath mat i slipped twice and my daughter had a bad fall hitting her head other than that was a lovely big room with a fab view of russell square 
 free wifi lovely heritage building good location for walking to shopping on bus route and close to underground concierge didn t even offer to take bags to room on arrival or assist with carrying up the fairly steep entrance stairs interior could do with a refreshment of decor to fit the outside heritage appearance 
 great location lovely friendly staff especially rocio who served us at our first breakfast and miles who made us laugh at the reception lovely building quiet considering being in london 
 hotel was excellent travelled for my birthday had a cake and bottle of wine in the room staff were brilliant stay in ph hotels a lot because they are brilliant hotels
 great central location staff very helpful and friendly good sized room 
 the location it is almost the centre but in a quiet place with perfect transport correspondence
 the comfort of the room was lovely and the decor was beautiful even though the noise from the roads outside could be heard it wasn t loud at all and we slept soundly the hotel looks and feels like it should be a lot more expensive for what it is and that s a testiment to the hotel a fantastic stay 
 good location very easy to reach the tube and british museum
 great location a block away from the russell square tube station on the piccadilly line easy to access buses too british museum is a close and easy walk away euston st pancras and king s cross train stations are nearby beautiful marble y interior excellent and friendly staff everything worked well appointed bathroom 
 location is great next to a tube station and walking distance from euston good staff comfy and clean room got a deal via a website so well worth the stay good base to explore 
 to be honest it had a strategic place near the russel square underground station and a little bit a way walking to oxford street it looks luxurious from the outside while it s not on the inside 
 the hotel itself is stunning with the marble staircases and ornate ceilings breakfast was great too

 around the corner from the london eye and used it for a trafalgar trip as the pickup for our tour was around the corner walked down to the borough market and took a river cruise to greenwich plent of eating spots close by as well over the bridge was westminster abbey parliament house and big ben and walked to trafalgar square as well also a laundry available which is very helpful 
 you re always my hotel of choice you re staff are incredible and recently you ve been giving me wonderful upgrades i always recommend you and when work ask me if i have a preference of accommodation you re my first pick i ve been staying with you for years so thank you
 the staff were all excellent the reception staff especially they went out of their way to make the kids feel welcome 
 the location it was so close to the london eye and the rest of the popular attractions that it was easy for my wife to go with the kids while i attendend a course at the hotel the rooms were comfortable and fair enough space 
 room was very well appointed and facilities were good
 staff was very helpful restaurant offered great food excellent location walking distance to waterloo station and several landmarks 
 were staying in london for just one night and the location was perfect we paid around  for one night for a family suite and it was very well worth the money 
 location
 location was great easy walk to london eye and big ben as well as many other attractions in this area hotel staff were great very helpful breakfast buffet was very good food was very fresh and well presented and although very busy staff were very efficient to make sure every one was well looked after 
 location to city attractions the room was comfortable and quiet bathroom was clean and the hot water in the shower was plentiful 
 the location is the perks here it is walking distance to the london eye and everything near it it is also about a  minute walk away from the nearest tube station there are many little cafes nearby so overall it is really convenient 
 it was a great stay for me and my family everybody in the hotel was so helpful especially courtney at the reception desk everything in the hotel was excellent including breakfast when we go to london again we will definitely stay in this hotel 
 convenience location  mins walk to waterloo tube station  mins to london eye suggest to choose a room with outside view finally paid  per night to upgrade 
 location perfect staff we went into the wrong hotel initially thinking that the park plaza building at the westminster bridge is the same as the county hall hotel it wasn t the staff at the park plaza westminster hotel were all very warm and welcoming their hospitality felt genuine right from the guy who greeted us at the main entrance all the way up to the lady at the reception who gave us directions going to the park plaza county hall hotel which was the adjacent building at the back they were all smiley and happy to assist us on the other hand the staff at the county hotel were polite and did their job alright the lady at the reception gave us a voucher for two complimentary drinks at the bar while we waited and they checked if the room was the ready it was a quick min wait which was fine no greeting nor smile at all from the bartender and the waiter at the spectrum bar it was h and the bar was definitely not busy the difference between our experience between the staff from both park plaza hotels was just really evident that i had to put it here room superior room we stayed for our anniversary we got a complimentary full bottle of wine greeting card and they decorated our room with petals and swan folded towels we were also assigned to a corner room with a view of the big ben and london eye which was very beautiful at night the tv monitor in the room serves like a multimedia browser where you can view your current room bill do self check out watch youtube videos listen to the radio etc the bedroom and bath were just the right size it was not small but not too big as well we didn t have a lot of luggage with us so it was just right mini bar was stocked with the basics we liked that there were extra pillows for us to use bed was comfortable to sleep on but was really really squeaky and we re not big people at all if you know what i mean breakfast good old continental and english breakfast 
 great staff comfortable quiet rooms breakfast upstairs was good 
 we had a horrible stay nothing other than location satisfied 
 i liked that there were crockery cutlery a microwave in the room
 the location is fantastic about  minutes walk to the waterloo station and london eye the studio double room is made up of  smaller rooms interconnected by a mini kitchenette there are kitchenware and microwave for use one room consist of a queen size bed and a sofa bed in the other suitable for family of  there is a public laundry room for those who would like their laundry to be done 
 plenty of room in the studio double comfy bed great location to westminster sights and right off the waterloo tube stop 
 nice breakfast and dinner avaliable
 friendly staff good location
 the hotel location is great it is a walking distance to london eye westiminster bridge parliament square westminster abbey buckingham palace and many more the staffs are great and very responsive to request

 very good breakfast and nice staff for service we would love to stay here again if there any chance
 the staff were kind polite very helpful and you could have a joke with them too we received a room upgrade upon check in the room was fabulous the hotel was clean and well presented we loved it and would definitely stay again and recommend to others 
 breakfast was awesome staff were very friendly and extremely helpful the bar restaurant was very convenient and provided great service loved the food and drinks they had to offer the bedroom and shower was nice i enjoyed my stay and would definitely book a room at park plaza county hall next time i m in town in terms of location you can t beat it all the landmarks are within walking distance and waterloo station is just around the corner so you can get around town on the tube very easily 
 the staff were very friendly and helpful and the room was clean and comfortable 
 great location and helpful porters and concierge staff 
 nothing
 breakfast that was available no veggie full breakfast was very good with nice pastries staff were nice and sociable throughout the hotel 
 location of the property
 upgraded our room went out of their way to quickly check us in the restaurant was a pleasant surprise very good food and service 
 location was great to be honest but after that it s all down hill 
 welcoming staff on the front desk very helpeful amazing location and view from bedroom 
 great central location  min walk from london eye big ben waterloo station very clean hotel and great service 
 the kitchenette in the room is just the thing a family needs the view of london eye is great the staff is quite responsive to all needs this includes everyone from front desk restaurant housekeeping and concierge they were very courteous and helpful to us the breakfast is very good too a lot of variety the hotel location is the best part very close to the waterloo station a number of trains to places outside of london originate terminate here couple of bus stops are also nearby westminster bridge london eye and other tourist attractions on the river bank are just a short walk the county hall area has a few decent restaurants a starbucks and a convenience store the booking com offer of free entry tickets to various attractions saved us a lot of money it is a very good offer 
 little extras made a big difference it was a hot day when we arrived to our room yet the staff had left a keycard in the slot so the air on continued to run had closed the curtains so the room was comfortable there were drinks not the normal water but fruit juices which the kids loved we were a towel short  evening  phone call to reception towels appeared at the door within  minutes the location is superb  minutes walk from waterloo train station so easy access a stone throw from the london eye the south bank a bridge walk to either westminster or soho we were on the th floor we could have been in the country it was quiet no road or plane noise at all 
 loved the location close to two subway stations big rooms with microwave gym and sauna aurora spa services also great liked the good security on entering the property would go back again especially with families 
 superb location and excellent room
 breakfast was just okay family suite was perfect pretty quiet even at night close to all major london attractions except greenwich shakespeare s globe but we walked there just fine 
 great stay superb location comfy beds good english breakfast friendly staff front desk 
 location was helpful cleanliness was average reception was nice 
 the bed was a good size and the sofa bed was good good with nespresso machine and microwave we ended up with good big windows and a light room 
 staff were exceptional i wish there were a higher rating friendly and chatty while still being highly efficient and making sure our stay was perfect this hotel is an ideal spot for a trip to london we could walk a large majority of places we wanted to go but still very quiet and restful the kitchenette is a lively touch we didn t cook but it apenabled us to store snacks cereal etc and milk and water on the fridge plenty of wardrobe and storage space bathroom shower in particular was excellent breakfast each morning was great and though there are a large number of peopl  floors highly organised and efficient wifi was great easily able to stream netflix etc and there was a big screen tv with many apps and all the premium channels 
 i have been several times in london this is my best hotel stay close to everything 
 the location can t be beaten the separation between the two beds allows parents to hang out in one side of the room while the kids sleep in peace on the other side 
 staff at breakfast were very good concierge staff security staff were excellent very helpful good breakfast for the money 
 room was comfortable but very small more intimate than private but clean and tidy shower difficult to use and poor screen means it leaks on the bathroom floor compact sink but all in all everything you need and hotel affords a great location 
 proximity excellent
 we were greeted so warmly and treated like old friends by the chef upon our late arrival to the restaurant the first night he was an outstanding ambassador for the hotel and made us feel very welcome and special 
 i like the location that is close to london eye big ben and the themes i like the nice room size 
 the staff was extra helpful and friendly the breakfast was good and the chef made sure we got what we wanted i also like that the hotel was close to where we wanted to be 
 complimentary upgrade to suite well received room absolutely perfect especially after long working day location is great for south bank and county hall exhibitions and conferences 
 the room was lovely small by american standards but to be expected in europe the beds were very comfy and the room has a coffee and refrigeration station plenty of storage for your clothing and bags perfect room for  people lovely hotel would stay here again location is superb 
 doorman was very helpful obtaining a taxi for a early morning flight helped with our luggage and opening the taxi doors for myself and my travel buddy 
 the hotel staff were lovely and i loved the layout of the room also my mother called in to do something special for my birthday and the hotel staff were great about it big thank you to them 
 comfy beds and sheets huge room with fridge and microwave two tellies very polite and helpful reception staff 
 we had a corner room on the th floor with two large windows spectacular views of big ben palace of westminster the london eye and the city skyline over the waterloo train station this location is awesome to go to all the southbank attractions restaurants waterloo train underground station westminster bridge and longer walks along the thames with easy access across the many bridges into the center of the city summer night life is so much fun as the sun didn t set until after   pm and we enjoyed a glass of wine or a pitcher of pimm s at the southbank centre almost every night the room was spacious especially for a hotel in london and the bed was large and comfy this is a high rise hotel so not a boutique hotel experience but the location and value for the price can t be beat the staff were super friendly and very helpful we didn t eat at the restaurant on site so can t give a review but would highly recommend this hotel 
 nothing in particular
 this is the first time i d stayed in this hotel but it certainly won t be the last from the staff on the reception desk and the concierges to the staff in the italian restaurant i could find no faults everyone was very welcoming and friendly by london standards the twin bedded room was surprisingly spacious and the bed pillows so comfortable 
 the way we were checked in by mariah giving us a good room and making our wedding anniversary so special 
 this hotel was very nice a great location near westminster bridge for city access the breakfast was very good a bonus was the free laundry for guests which was great after  weeks on the road the concierge was very friendly helpful as were the baggage guys on the front door 
 we didnt like our first room it was too dark but for more money we got shifted to a bigger room with great light we had continual problems with the tv volume everytime we turnef it on we had to call maintenance to fix the volume that was annoying the buffet breakfast was excellent but room service meal terrible they refunded our meal though 
 ideal location just a stones through from waterloo station clean rooms beautiful bathroom kettle fridge sink which was handy and iron ironing board in the room which was nice two tv s was a nice touch so that people in both parts of the room could watch tv comfortable bed too 
 modern rooms close to nearly tube station and a short walk to the london eye great location if you want to be close to tourist hot spots but dont want to stay in a super busy area clean and suitable rooms 
 the staff on duty in the lobby and at the front desk were great 
 nice central location lovely view from our bedroom most staff were very welcoming and nice 
 i liked the room layout because the bath room kitchen separated the room with the queen size bed and the living room which had a pull out couch that our  year old son stayed in 
 the cleanliness of the whole location 
 bar staff were attentive and service great
 extremely clean modern and updated great room set up for a family with two children the double bed is in one room and the kids have a fold out couch in the other 
 the location was great close to major attractions and transport we enjoyed the breakfasts we heard very little noise from waterloo station despite our room overlooking it 
 amazing staff great customer service spacious clean and comfortable room 
 plenty of selection at breakfast attentive staff 
 comfortable bed and a good sized room able to make hot drinks and having an ice machine in the hallway was a bonus water and sweets were left for us on arrival staff dealt with problems with the room quickly could to see part of the london eye and big ben from the window so we enjoyed the view laundry room was useful when you have a longer stay 
 very close to london eye and across the bridge from big ben and westminster abbey a small supermarket nearby and starbucks close to waterloo station
 great room with large size flat screen tv that had you tube videos and tv excellent staff and consierge service would come back here again to stay 
 superb location starting with london eye and westminster abbey big ben and some more within short walking distance public transportation and train stops also very close ideal if you don t have much time but want to get as much as possible as tourist though in the center and recent construction next to hotel but our room was very quiet provided noise cancellation i guess staff was very friendly and helpful highlighting magda on reception our cleaning lady nadia and one member i think sarah at the breakfast 
 staff were friendly and very helpful very impressed that we were afforded an upgrade which was appreciated as we had booked months in advance buffet breakfast more than adequate and restaurant foyer in evening provided seating and food for guests wanting a smaller meal also staying in hotel conceirage secured baggage during the day of departure while we were out 
 location good value restaurant excellent staff 
 the location is fantastic for exploring the south bank and walking along the river the room was on the th floor so had amazing views of the london eye comfortable bed overlooking the views of london 
 nice breakfast good kitchen staff
 room size was good and quiet and always cleaned
 perfect location near westminster bridge waterloo mainline and tube stations and  minutes to south bank promenade and the london eye close to all sights and facilities we stayed for  nights in a large king sized suite with a separate large living room with view of the shard also had small kitchen with fridge and microwave clean comfortable and great for an extended stay great staff super helpful and has the bonus of a guest laundry with washers and dryers on site restaurant bars and great nearby bistros and restaurants 
 overall hotel was centrally located and close to tourist attractions staff were courteous and helpful with information and very welcoming
 the view of the london eye was amazing especially at night the bed was so comfortable with a puffy duvet and quality linens breakfast included had a huge buffet with custom omelets 
 excellent staff who are wonderful with children light spacious rooms with good facilities excellent central location easy walking distance of many sights two tube stations river boats and tourist buses multiple eating options westminster southbank and london eye all nearby from reservations and reception to housekeeping and room service the staff couldn t have been more helpful or accommodating this is a really good hotel and great for family visits ours was a special family visit with grandparents parents and four grandchildren two children visiting for the first time and as a birthday treat the reservation and reception teams thanks to courtney michaela and i think sara apologies for any incorrect spelling helped organise rooms with a wonderful view and facilities which made the visit very special for the grandchildren and grown ups the children also enjoyed the glass lift reception staff were absolutely wonderful alba was so welcoming and made an instant friend when she gave our grandson a lollipop on arrival and arranged birthday balloons and chocolate cake in the room being able to arrange breakfast in the room made for a more relaxed start to the day and room service and housekeeping were so efficient and responsive managing to get our breakfast to us when we wanted it even when we forgot to put down the time for one of the rooms making the quietest meal delivery for the babysitters when the children were asleep and restoring order to our chaotic rooms while we were out this is the second time we have stayed at park plaza county hall and given the high quality of the rooms and the excellent customer service we intend to return 
 loved the view and the space
 the bed was very comfortable and was offered an upgrade with an awesome view of the london eye with an early check in
 rooms were great with lots of space to put clothes away and good cupboard in bathroom good coffee facilities and fridge to put own drink 
 staff were great and went the extra mile
 staff in the bar at lunchtime were lovely and the food was very good
 on the whole it was excellent
 the staff so so friendly and accomodating they went above and beyond to find room in the freezer for medications and the concierge helped us on a daily basis 
 all the staff were really friendly and helpful our family room was very spacious and comfortable with a great view breakfast was delicious with a good choice absolutely fabulous location for exploring london 
 room size was good and kitchen facilities were a great addition for drinks etc great view over london towards the shard and steps from the attractions on the embankment 
 location was perfect short walk from westminster great small restaurants and grocery shops nearby this place was a lifesaver after a dodgy previous hotel and they gave us a free upgrade 
 helpful staff and dining staff clean and neat nice breakfast where was the real butter 
 had a great time in london we were really close to transport if u want a boat trip on the thames or an open bus trip the underground and train station are close too we did a lot of sightseeing on foot walking to see the sights and even enjoy the parks and open spaces the weather was glorious for our stay so having a walk in a shady tree lined area was good during the hottest part of the day after each busy day we didn t have far to go back to the hotel to get changed and ready for the evening hopefully will visit again soon 
 room had no window it is noisy with staff talking outside the door i feel ripped off
 great hotel would stay again the only odd thing was was seats in the bar area were really old tatty and uncomftable which was really odd as everything else was great 
 on arrival room wasn t ready so they swapped our room and gave all  of us a complimentary drink excellent location to explore london parking was not with hotel but around corner  for  hours looks rough but perfectly good service 
 i only added a little request in my booking about it being my mums birthday we were overwhelmed with the view the balloons the wine and the card it was one of the best trips to london ever thank you you made my mother s birthday 
 pillows smells like french fries but bed was so comfortable 
 excellent location clean rooms cooperative staff 
 excellent location housekeeping was very quick to respond and deliver our requests the night concierge was especially terrific 
 great staff esp mariana receptionist good breakfast and location we were allocated in a very small dark twin room for the first night and asked for a room change next day the new room was comfortable with natural light 
 location was ideal for what we were doing in london thames cruise london dungeons and sea life centre
 can extend late check out up till pm by paying  pounds per hour
 excellent location with many major attractions like london eye big ben parliment houses all at walkable distances 
 the room we had was for  people and it was like a mini apartment with a double bedroom small kitchen area and then the sofa bed set up in the lounge great value between the  of us 
 in the center of london 
 staff were so helpful to make the night before and morning of my wedding lovely and stress free from providing a special room with a view to assisting with deliveries of flowers etc everything was great the suite with london eye view was wonderful thanks to all staff particularly concierge 
 the front desk staff was unfriendly we got a room facing all the construction asked for a room not facing the street construction not sure if the lady at the front desk was having a bad day but she gave a tiny room where the tv was tucked in a corner so only one side of th room could see the tv the bed was horribly uncomfortable 
 location and views great studio itself was lovely with good amenities soundproofing of the windows was also good 
 location was good and within easy walking distance of transport restaurant was ok and staff were friendly and helpful 
 the hotel was lovely staff were friendly and helpful i had an amazing room with a sitting area and kitchenette plus large bathroom with bath and shower plus i was happy to have been allocated a quiet room brilliant location about  minute walk from waterloo station 
 being upgraded to a suite it made the hotel visit so much more enjoyable the staff in the dining room were most helpful friendly and welcoming 
 gym was well equipped penthouse was spacious and well designed 
 everything was perfect especially the italian restaurant where the food was outstanding everyone were extremely nice and helpful and i mean everyone 
  min max walk from waterloo got bus back to victoria station for airport transfer outside door had a sick family member and got checking in early and option to upgrade which we gladly accepted for  per night
 convenient location
 excellent location for the london eye royal festival hall and south bank staff were very helpful as we had a slight incident with our first room and rectified the situation effectively upgraded us our junior suite had a lovely view over county hall and the london eye and was very clean

 we upgraded our room as we arrived early and it was only a small extra charge the room was amazing with a great view staff were really helpful and the location is amazing it s only a  minute stroll to the london eye so you re right in the middle on everything couldn t have asked for more 
 very children focussed welcome pack on arrival vouchers for icecream and drinks at bar

 upgraded a standard room to a mini suite for just   
 good location with good size rooms 
 the bed was very comfortable and our room very spacious we arrived on an early flight and we re lucky enough to check in early the hotel is in a great location for sightseeing easy access to waterloo or westminster stations and close enough to walk to lots of things if you have the time we have stayed here before and would definitely stay again 
 my room was excellent in all respects especially the bed tv bath etc i checked in at p and i had not realised that my internet booking did not include breakfast and i had to leave the hotel by  am in the morning a saturday breakfast room was opening later than usual as it was a saturday so no breakfast for this  year old at the price i paid for the one night  a hot something should have been quickly prepared for me or open the kitchen for a quick sustaining breakfast eg eggs or porridge etc or given me a packed breakfast 
 the room was nice and clean and fully equipped with the essential equipment needed while traveling e g ironing microwave hair dryer etc the hotel is close to london eye big bin   minutes walking and around   minutes away from hyde park and oxford street where all the well known shopping shops are breakfast was fine and the food is delicious

 travelling to london was stressful as i had never driven into london before however it was not as difficult as i had anticipated it was easy to pull up at the hotel and park temporarily it is unfortunate to know that the hotel does not have parking on site this was however this was mitigated by the hotel having valet service which was excellently efficient however left me out of pocket to the tune of  however this was still cheaper and less stressful than using public transport the hotel itself was beautiful the accommodation we had was tastefully decorated you could see a lot of thought and investment was put into it the bed was comfortable i m sad to say it was better than our own for a fantastic experience i would recommend the last floor th the views were fantastic from the balcony the staff were excellent you could tell they didn t just pluck anyone from the streets give them a  minute induction and let them loose they were very knowledgeable and eager to help without being intrusive i can t comment on their food as we didn t eat there there is plenty of restaurants around though can t rate them though as we only used one which was actually good the sites nearby were excellent which was the main reason for our trip the london eye parliarment big ben london dungeons amongst others were all within a very short walking distance away others could easily be reached either by train or buses all in all i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone

 location was very good room and bathroom very clean proper coat hangers
 loved our room it was fantastic the only thing that let it down is it was facing over a railway line and buildings so the view was a bit rubbish but that wasnt a majour issue the lady on the desk francessca i think she was called such a lovely lady and the only staff member apart from the bar staff that genuinely made us feel welcome 
 a lovely hotel with friendly helpful staff they went out of their way to stop a light flashing on the phone beside the bed which would have lit up the room every minute otherwise

 we arrived at  am and the staff offered us an option for a room right away which was reasonable and allowed us to clean up before hitting the sights in london great although the view was far from good it didn t matter to us since we were leaving however not sure they should have charged us extra given the view i think if you are going to charge an extra  pounds for early access then for the money something should be provided like a view but we greatly appreciated having a room to store our stuff and clean up after such a long flight from us 
 courtney on the front desk was excellent the rooms were very well furnished big and clean the shower was superb a kitchen area was a welcome plus the hotel catered for food allergies the hotel was close to waterloo station near westminster bridge and the london eye london dungeons sea life

 attention to children and nothing is too difficult for staff 
 i was completely disappointed and mad since the reception staff are generally unfriendly more specifically brad brad not only he talks to guests with an attitude and from an upper position he always thinks he is right without notification to me or alignment with me he deducted the whole amount of the stay from my credit card instead of preauthorization he claimed that this is the hotel policy to deduct the whole amount if the stay is more than  nights i told him i was not aware of such policy and asked him to show me where it is written he said it is not written anywhere and the hotel is not supposed to show the guests all the policies i told him i disagree especially if it is related to terms and payments i asked to speak to his manager he said i am the manager then i asked to speak to his superior then he said i will cancel the sales and preauthoriz again the amount i told him this will not work as it will take at least  days to reverse the payment he said that he is sure it will take few hours unfortunately he cancelled it and took  working days during this period the amount he deducted was stuck between banks and the hotel keeps trying to preauthoriz the amount and notifications from my bank keeps coming to my phone with failed attempted of course those attempts hurt my credit records with the bank i was devastated and angry but no one said sorry and no compensation were provided to me horrible customer experience 
 location was great

 staff was incredible everyone at front desk extremely helpful and friendly they could not do enough each day i returned i felt like i had come home based on research i asked for a high floor with partial view of arc de triumphe i got exactly what i asked for room large especially for a city like paris bright with a balcony that had the view to the arc amenities in room were everything you would hope for large and well lit bath metro a  minute walk bus to both airports just across the street 
 our stay here was excellent from the location to the staff we got the room with a view and it was absolutely amazing you could see the arc so close the pictures don t do it justice this was our first time in paris and we loved it farouk went out of the way to help us and book stuff we wanted to do around the city if it wasn t for him the stay wouldn t have been the same he was as good as the view we had would definitely recommend it 
 we had an amazing stay the rooms are very cozy with an amazing view of the arc de triumph i felt like home my entire stay staff was nice all the time would definitely stay again at this amazing little hotel 
 the staff and location of this hotel were great the hotel is located very conveniently near the arc de triomphe and the entrance to the metro underground it was very easy to access my office at la defence all the resturants and shopping as well as all the tourist sites and it also had a great view from the balcony 
 the room with the view was just fantastic very confortable cozy and clean amazing balcony where you just wanna stay whole day comfortable bed very polite and helpful staff

 the location is excellent
 the hotel location was great the hotel room was excellent and i can say that it can be compared to  stars hotels the room was always clean with beautiful views 
 the view was absolutely amazing very nice and cozy room perfect location at the arc de triomphe and champs elysees right in front of the metro 
 beautiful room friendly staff and an amazing view of the arc de triomphe well placed for attractions in paris close to the metro and within walking distance of the eiffel tower 
 excellent hotel wonderful staff very convenient location as it s right on top of literally a metro via lift definitely worth getting the arc de triomphe view 
 clean rooms no noise even when so close to the main street excellent balcony with a super view th floor nicely decorated safe everything you need for a perfect stay close to the metro station and this line brings you to all good places 
 we had a beautiful room for three on the six floor with a full view of the arc de triumphe and a partial view of the eiffel tower every detail was lovely newly decorated i believe and tastefully done in soft colors it was a pleasure to stay at this hotel 
 had a one night stay at this hotel and have nothing but praise for this hotel be sure to get superior room that has fantastic view on arc de triomphe and enjoy your morning coffee routine or wine evenings on terrace overall room was clean and cosy and very quiet and comfortable for good night rest hotel staff was very courteous informative and helpful i ll definitely stay here again and make sure it is more then one night 
 the chief concierge farooq was extremely helpful with all our luggages it was of walking distance to the champs elysees and generally not difficult to find for taxi drivers the cafe across the road was also pleasant and does good cheeseburgers 
 very comfortable clean refurbished and great location 
 the staff were sooooo friendly i am a young woman who stayed alone during a business trip and i felt very safe and welcome 
 fab location great helpful staff breakfast expensive 
 fantastic location and staff this property owner is involved and attends to detail it shows up with the clean and well maintained property along with his staff s attention to the guests 
 excellent value for money room very clean quite and had a great view we stayed on the th floor would definitely stay there again and recommend t anyone
 next to arc de triomphe with beautiful view well run and maintained hotel elegantly finished 
 could not have asked for a better and a more comfortable stay in paris in terms of location it doesn t get any better than this if you opt for a room with a view like we did then you get a view that is the envy of all arc de triomphe we did not opt for breakfast in the hotel since there are numerous patisseries and cafes around despite arriving at the hotel way before our check in time the concierge accommodated us almost immediately the rooms are large by european standards very clean and airy i m talking about the rooms with a view friendly and courteous staff added to our stay a special mention of mr farukh who floored us with his hospitality and generosity of ideas thank you splendid etoile you truly made our stay splendid

 very friendly staff location was not bad the view was great they allowed us to check in very early 
 the staff was really really helpful recommended us where to eat how to travel around paris etc we are travelling in a group of  people with many large luggages at first we decided to go the cdg airport by rer cos if we take the taxi we would have to take  taxis then it will cost a lot but the staff arranged us a minivan taxi to take us all together it was very convenient
 the small balcony overlooking the arch and the metro station which is right outside the hotel entrance
 location is amazing very close to champs elysees staff were so friendly and helpful doing everything to please us and our little dog we were upgrade from classic room to superior room what made our trip much more special the room balcony view is spectacular we had such a wonderful time that we decided to stay an extra night 
 the location was perfect right outside the rer and metro walking distance from the arc de triomphe and the air france shuttle bus the hotel staff found out that we were on honeymoon and upgraded our room throughout the stay they were very helpful helped us print tickets quick to bring up requests like towels pillows and glasses and gave directions and suggestions for tourist to do s in paris the rooms are a bit small but it s an average size for european hotel rooms they also look exactly the same as the pictures advertised on the site overall a great place to stay in paris highly recommend it

 this is the third time we stayed at this hotel it is simply great perfect location and the staff is lovely definitely recommend it to anyone who is visiting paris this time i was traveling as family and they gave us a lovely family room on the th floor the view was absolutely superb 
 location surpassed expectations very comfortable bed and pillows wonderful large window to open almost like a patio which overlooked the cool old neighborhood wonderful breeze as i laid in bed no screen but no bugs i think we had a tiny glimpse of the eiffel tower from the window the tiny elevator was actually really fun for my daughter the tub was great the staff were incredibly nice they even helped me to my uber which wasn t necessary and made sure he was taking me to the right place the proximity to the wonderful luxembourg gardens was heavenly 
 the view was amazing the hotel is wonderful and the breakfast was great already planning our visit back thank you for the best stay in paris 
 location good for the rer b for both airports 
 the hotel was in a brilliant location the staff were very nice and welcoming and the rooms were quite comfortable and cosy would definitely recommend staying here when visiting paris

 very convenient and cosy hotel close to some of the nicest places of paris the view from the room is amazing from eiffel tower to montmartre and notre dame the staff is helpful to have a nice stay in paris 
 friendly staff excellent location furnishings a bit aged but not below expections 
 the location was great and the staff was super friendly and eager to help the breakfast had more items than i expected for example i don t drink caffeinated drinks or coffee and they had a brewed herbal tea to my surprise they had both regular yogurt and greek yogurt had a machine that squeezed fresh orange juice by the glass and there were other pleasant surprises also our room was in the old part of the hotel and had a view of the eiffel tower that was a totally unexpected treat although i also listed it in the negatives the elevator in the old part of the hotel was comically small it could barely fit  person i don t know how the bellman got our  suitcases and  rolling carryons into it i imagine he put them in the elevator pressed the floor button and raced it to our floor th 
 location was just excellent staff were very friendly rooms a little on the small side but this is to be expected for paris really very very good hotel would definitely stay there if visiting paris again 
 fantastic hotel near the sorbonne on the paris left bank close to many restaurants and bars but outside the tourist zone our room was a decent size and very comfortable the hotel has character but has been refurbished and tastefully decorated our room faced the street but at night it was quiet there are always refreshments in reception and very friendly staff 
 the environment around is great a v lib station is in front of the hotel it takes about  minutes to go to cath drale norte dame de paris by walking there are some asian style restaurants around the corner for people miss udon with hot soups 
 nice room very quiet in the night the bed was comfortable we particularily liked the bath tub and the small refrigerator the breakfast buffet was good the cold juice and water offered free of charge in the early afternoon was nice my daughter especially liked the pc and the candies in the reception area 
 the location is very convenient but quiet my husband and i were traveling with our adult daughter and were able to book a connecting room for her she had a completely separate room but we did not have to pay double the price of one room the rooms were large by european standards 
 wonderful staffs beautiful breakfast room and foods elegantly displayed and served gracious hospitality overall convenient location for public transportation 
 excellent location and comfortable hotel very pleasant staff   minutes walk to isle de la cite and about   walk to the metro plenty of nice cafes and restaurants nearby
 just location
 asked about a room upgrade with balcony the staff offered a great upgrade for  euros more it had a view of the eiffel tower gorgeous 
 great location for pantheon and shopping 
 very good location safe and quiet in latin quarter can walk or take metro easily to most attractions and rer directly to the airport and late afternoon i can always have a recess at the bueatiful luxembourg park around the corner plenty of nice and affordable local and asian restaurants i like especially au p re louis and sushiyaki i stayed for six nights and came back for dinner every day this area is only a couple of minutes walk off the major tourist zone but already much less noisy and you got better food and service my room is on top floor and the view is awesome one day i saw sunset on effel tower and it was amazing 
 bed comfortable staff very friendly location super early breakfast in the room is very convenient when you are in a hurry like i was 
 the staff could not have been more obliging i arrived direct from australia was seriously unwell they are definitely worth more than   for sevice 
 beautiful room quiet location comfortable bed friendly staff particularly the receptionists who helped store the luggage and giving directions when requested
 well decorated and comfortable room with big balcony window we like the location of the hotel very much and have been back a number of times when in paris 
 great location staff was friendly and helpful 
 nice hotel in a great location next to luxembourg gardens and the pantheon and  mins walk to center of saint michel the hotel also has lovely little balconies overlooking the rooftops so i recommend you get a room on the top floors 
 great location comfortable small rooms descent though slightly over priced breakfast 
 my room was a good size for paris the decor was lovely and very french which was nice
 beautiful view of the city including side view of the eiffel tower easy access to everything including public transportation and restaurants nice soft and clean sheets along with soft pillows clean comfortable bathroom well equipped with toiletries 
 good location and comfortable room room serviced everyday buses nearly opposite hotel go to the gare du nord for the eurostar excellent choice of restaurants a short walk away 
 good location not so far from notre dame cathedral  metro station frendly staff beautiful view from room nice area around price quality ratio 
 every thing was wonderful the only aspect i would add to the bathroom is a magnifying mirror a great help for shaving and makeup the beds are comfortable and the rooms well appointed though a little snug but one has to remember this is a lovely period building in central paris the breakfast was excellent and the staff very helpful making eggs fresh to order there was fruit in the lobby together with little cakes and umbrellas the reception staff were most helpful providing maps information restaurant recommendations and reservations 
 hotel is in a great location with metro nearby the luxembourg gardens are nearby which are lovely to stroll through and are perfect for relaxing in during hot weather the hotel was modern and had a touch of paris to its interior with staff always haply to help the room was nice and spacious enough for  people 
 we ve stayed here before and enjoyed it just as much a second time excellent location near jardins du luxembourg friendly staff tea and coffee in room is a bonus for paris 
 we loved that it was located in a nice quiet neighborhood not in a touristy location so close to public transportation and walking places the staff was always available and friendly breakfast was tasty and the hostess was so sweet she remembered exactly how we liked our coffee although the rooms are small ours was perfect we will request a room higher up and with a balcony next time there wasn t one available on this trip 
 nice parisian feel to the hotel loved the lift which was modern while keeping the old fashioned appeal very nice reception and guest area great location for exploring the left bank notre dame and louvre areas 
 staff very friendly and will g to assist in either english or french nice clean bathroom large tub ok water pressure 
 good price great location good side view of eiffel tower very good comparing to my other hotels booked in paris which usually have very small rooms 
 nicest bed i ve slept in in paris in a long time also very quiet even though it was on a busy street
 very close to major sites and great cafes quiet at night as well being in the location that it is in 
 me and my husband stayed for three nights and felt so happy with this hotel the location is only  minutes walking from luxembourg rer station and also surrounded by fancy stores mini market and some interesting places e g palais du luxembourg and odeon theatre the room itself was a bit small but very clean and comfortable the best thing about the room was the view we asked to have a best view room when we checked in and the staff gave us a room on the th floor with stunning view of eiffel tower don t worry be happy they have an elevator another good thing about this hotel was its short distance to a good indonesian restaurant named indonesia really worth a try please google the location for details 
 very good location 
 small old style hotel
 tray in room with coffee sachets and kettle 
 very good location just seven min walk from notre dame cathedral twenty min from the louvre museum modern facilities and antique furniture a nice syncretism helpful staff 
 even everyone who travelled paris before said that hotel rooms are really small it wasn t that much our room was more bigger than we thought the location is excellent near to rer b station luxembourg also a transfer station like odeon and cluny just walking distance to pantheon luxembourg gardens etc in addition near to a big market monoprix 
 i stayed for  days on the end of november staff was nice room was clean and good as i asked for a window with good air because i have severe dust allergy and i m very impressed the breakfast by room service was good and on time bus stop and subway aren t far from accommodation it s valuable to stay in paris if i came back which i will i ll stay in this accommodation again 
 close to notre dame staff was nice the hotel was looking good
 i was staying for  nights and the room was really too small they changed me to a larger room without any problem
 wonderful room at the th floor huge n very neat tea pot made my stay much warmer in the morning it was a bit chilly in the room really enjoyed the nice stay and great view over the city thank you 
 brilliant location for palais de luxembourg sorbonne etc friendly and helpful new bathroom facilities and bed great 
 hotel was spotless breakfast was fab something to suit everyone staff were extremely friendly and helpful hotel is excellently located next to the metro

 i had forgotten my passport in the room safe and they were quite efficient to recover it

 breakfast room ladies were delightful friendly breakfast was pretty good clean and tidy with complimentary toiletries in bathroom

 good location to explore the city and st germain we were only in paris for one night but would have been comfortable to stay here for more 
 i do really love the balcony we spent many days here and every morning when i wake up the balcony made me a very happy morning the location is also great for women there are many nice food restaurants and nice shops you do not need to worry that nothing to do in the evening because near the hotel there are also many nice bar with good view just  minutes walk to luxembourg park is also great 
 breakfast was very good bedroom very comfortable hotel just off the boulevard st germaine near notre dame not close to a lot of tourist attractions but reasonable wslking distance

 although the room was a bit small but for paris standards it was fine we were very comfortable the room was clean with a very comfortable bed and a nice bathroom the breakfast was also great fresh squeezed orange juice hot food french pastries bread and more we have nothing but praise for this hotel 
 the location is really the best there are lots of places to eat and close to the metro as well you re a   minute walk away from the notre dame as well our room was lovely comfy beds and enough space for  girls with way more luggage than necessary we also had a view of the eiffel tower which was a super surprise when we looked out of the window perfect 
 location receptionist ordered taxi for us
 property was in a good location away from the main tourist attractions it was in a decent condition feels like it could do with an upgrade soon though staff were helpful and internet connection was good 
 we have been coming to this little hotel for some time now and are pleasantly surprised at the improvements over the years we loved the fresh orange juice machine
 the staff was always friendly and helpful breakfast was great cleaning person amazing great location great restaurants nearby

 the location is wonderful if you like to spend time in the latin quarter which i do great restaurants in the area close to notre dame cathedral plenty of rer metro stops in case you don t want to walk or would like to get over to the eiffel tower or champs elysee i am on my first around the globe trip which means i ve been on the road for while so the laundromat right on the next block also gave me the opportunity to run a load of laundry for  euros rather than the ridiculous fee a hotel would charge

 felt totally welcome with our younger kids all staff interactions were really pleasant the adjoining rooms were perfect and for paris we had plenty of room and a huge closet to get our stuff put away restaurants super close by so if kids are babysitting age parents can go across the street for a nice dinner 
 excellent position close to many attractions on the left bank with proximity to rer and metro stations comfortable room and very friendly helpful staff 
 we liked the location and the fact that the building kept its old world integrity the staff did their best to be helpful

 amy on reception was brilliant and went out of her way to make our stay perfect we even got a complimentary cake delivered to our room as we were celebrating our th anniversary thanks to all the staff 
 the staff treated us like old friends and were helpful without being overbearing i took my car which was parked overnight without any problems 
 the location was good
 not only was the hotel of a luxurious standard what else would you expect of a five star on park lane but it was the attitude of the staff who really made our trip extra special upon arrival i mentioned that it was our th wedding anniversary and asked if there was a chance of a complimentary upgrade luckily they weren t full so we got a lovely upgrade to an exec room which was super spacious and a free late check out not only that when we returned from our meal out the reception manager had organised for a beautiful chocolate gateaux and bottle of red wine to be in our room on the house such a classy move considering we were already more than happy with the upgrade and really made our trip even more special considering we re not your average five star hotel clientele i was so impressed by the intercontinental s approach to treating us like vip s you made our anniversary so memorable and we ll definitely return again 
 undoubtedly a luxurious hotel excellent facilities and a great gin menu the hotel is perfectly located to explore many of the capital s best known landmarks and shopping streets on foot 
 great location helpful polite and well trained staff although the breakfadt room melee and staff involved were a little less well organised
 i m very pleased that we choose to stay at intercontinental london park lane this time me and my sister loved every thing about it we were feeling most welcome everyday every moment i already rated the property  but what i really wanted to mention here is the concierge micheal petar and the others were so helpful too but those guys manage to find us bookings in no time in the most wanted places restaurants opera etc we felt so spoiled this time thanks to them i totally recommend this hotel the location is amazing to the breakfast buffet is almost similar to our hotels in the gulf very tasty with lots of choices not only an english breakfast like any other hotel we are totally booking in it again 
 everything is perfect the reception rooms cleanliness and the staff i really recommend this hotel 
 excellent breakfast and good service very comfortable room and bed personal touch of card and cake for anniversary proximity to st james park and buckingham palace for a walk the morning after our celebration dinner 
 this was the worse experience for me ever i didn t like anything in the hotel and i checked out from the second day and shifted to another hotel

 everything was great on my recent stay in that hotel and all was up to perfect in terms of the staff and the exotic services and facility provided by the hotel also location is fabulous one thing i would like to mention about my experience with that hotel i made my booking through hotel booking web site and it was non refundable one month and a half before my arrival so when i have checked the price of the room i have booked later in the site i found cheaper than the price i booked my room for so i made i contact the hotel booking customer service and explain the matter and they have respond immediately to my request and sent a notification to the reservation department in intercontinental park lane hotel and thay agreed right away to modify it and they sent me a new booking confirmation with the new price offered in the website i appreciate that so much and proof to me that is hotel booking is the best choise to book my hotel in my future trip

 breakfast ok
 great rooms large clean well equipped awesome staff several games at reception for kids and not only 
 the hotel the staff and everything else is great but the location isn t so good its a really rough area
 the room was amazing value for money plenty of room to spread out for a young family self contained kitchenette was handy for a long stay 
 the rooms were big and beautiful nothing to complain about the only problem we had was we had booked adjoining rooms and when we went to the hotel they said they don t have adjoining rooms it was the fault of bookings com to mention that it was adjoining rooms and not the hotels fault so with the kids we had to use  rooms which was inconvenient really to be in completely separate rooms and the location is not that great and a little scary to travel after dark the staff not that friendly or helpful either 
 the rooms are clean and cosy the staff are polite and helpful

 location and staff
 staff were very helpfull hotel was clean location close to  underground stations bayswater and queensway close to shops and hyde park 
 i booked this hotel because of the architecture of the actual building and the price was ok the building was beautiful 
 the room single though small was very comfortable the breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice the staff polite helpful and efficient 
 the bed was very comfortable
 the breakfast was amazing so much to choose from there s something for everyone
 breakfast was very good style of the hotel suited what we like 
 the property was historically interesting and the staff were excellent 
 the loacation is very good 
 typical london hotel in historical building friendly staff good location value for money pictures of the hotel on web site are real 
 the room was smaller than expected but furnished in a way that made it very comfortable and usable i also liked the electricity saving device that turns off all the lights once you leave the room 
 old hotel was grand once no doubt reminded me of genteel poverty our room looked onto back of other buildings and dumpsters which were unloaded early in the morning very small rooms busy street on other side of the square with shops lots of tourist tat chemists and eateries 
 staff was friendly the hotel was clean and the breakfast really good 
 the breakfast was fantastic and the staff were brilliant they were really friendly and always keen to help very close to queensway tube and on the doorstep to hyde park 
 hotel was relying on its location undeniably good but the room and bathroom sizes will eventually be it s undoing people expect more these days and are prepared to pay more
 the staff and management were top class and very helpful nothing was too much trouble for them the breakfast was excellent with a good choice of food the rooms were smallish but the service compensated for that thumbs up for this hotel good location just off bayswater road close to queensway and bayswater tube stations 
 room clean and smart 
 i asked for a quiet room and i only heard one siren but the outlook over the dumpsters wasn t spectacular it was a surprise to receive half a bottle of wine don t like merlot so my friend enjoyed it but the thought was nice 
 breakfast was excellent
 i had to wait at reception for check in for  minutes and i was annoyed the kind italian gentlemen at the reception added free breakfast for me and kept trying to crack jokes until i had a smile and accepted the apology the free breakfast was very good and i would definitely of paid for it variety of things to have i checked out but my meeting was at pm they let me wait at the lovely waiting room downstairs until i was ready to leave the staff definitely cared about their customer being happy thank you i d definitely come again
 the only positive is the location of this hotel 
 great old building that s kept in good shape immediate access to hyde park and a nearby london underground station were both very nice the staff were busy but alert nice and efficient 
 very welcoming staff requested a room with a bath i received it gorgeous character and reception lounge area with fresh flowers excellent price 
 location near two tube lines and hyde park public areas were beautiful vintage 
 the staff was really friendly and they upgraded us to a coach room 
 the rooms were not in good shape the st room was so small we could just about get  suitcases into the room and then there was no floor space for an ironing board we requested a change the next room was better though in a semi basement but the toilet was so small and the wash basin smaller about inchx inches the tap looked enormous since the basin could not have been any smaller the pictures of the rooms should be made accurate 
 awesome location very close to queensway tube and bayswater tube shops restaurants convenience stores hyde park bus stop excellent reception and staff although my room was small which is normal by central london standards it was extremely well appointed had everything one would need breakfast was excellent too good spread freshly prepared 
 all the staff were polite and welcoming and arranged taxis do my destination as required you never felt second best excellent hotel and staff
 the staff were very helpful and polite 
 our room was small as was the bathroombut it was clean and comfortable the location of the hotel is excellent walking distance to restaurants and shopping kensington gardens is right on the doorstep perfect for an early morning run it s an easy walk to many attractions including the portobello markets the hotel is charming with comfortable lounge areas 
 the hotel was very clean breakfast and tea were great service was great at the meals as well common areas were beautiful each room had its own temperature control including ac location was great 
 location was very close to the queensway tube easy to find friendly check in and check out bathroom was very clean and recently refurbished i will look at staying here again as it is ideal for my business trips 
 near to hyde park which is what we wanted
 location
 good breakfast selection and quality complimentary water and teas were great a wonderful last minute stay in a hotel that felt part of the history of london yet was beautifully up to date in facilities
 staff were friendly and great location especially for the price 
 lovely old building pleasant staff very handy for hyde park concerts lancaster gate tube station about  mins walk 
 good location
 staff were amazing and attentive from the moment i arrived at reception desk the guy at reception was checking  separate groups in at once so nobody had to wait got me a room with a bath as i asked for gave me late check out the next day i have stayed in lots of hotels all over the world for alot more money and the service here was one of the best i have ever experienced 
 the building history edwardian design in the public areas 
 good breakfast a beautiful old building full of character comfy bed quiet 
 the location was perfect for an event we were attending in hyde park the room was clean helpful staff who responded to my concern about the comfort of the room politely 
 location 
 it was central for  get where you wanted  be it was nice clean staff were helpful polite 
 it s in a beautiful location i love the old english feel the lobby has and the staff is very nice 
 good location easy enough to get to by tube from kings cross and lovely that the history has been preserved great choice at breakfast i ve stayed twice with different friends and they both agreed it was lovely 
 great restaurant wonderful atmosphere and excellent location 
 our stay at the grand royale marked the start of our honeymoon we arrived to a bottle of wine chocolates a selection of fruit and a handwritten card in our room the staff were attentive and pleasant and we were allowed a late check out at no extra cost breakfast was superb with a huge choice of cooked or continental options we loved the building with its extensive wood panelling and beautiful friezes on walls and ceilings the history of the building made for interesting reading too we were delighted with our choice of hotel and will return when we next visit london we highly recommend the grand royale 
 very comfortable bed in a double room on the th floor so it was nice and quiet good location within a few hundred yards of bayswater road and only four minute walk from bayswater tube station 
 staff very friendly and helpful hotel rooms and lobby spotlessly clean rooms are small but perfectly formed with all mod cons 
 a really good location close to hyde park and central london staff were polite attentive extremely friendly and helpful we will definitely stay here again when visiting london good value 
 the location of the hotel as we were visiting hyde park the history ambience of the original edwardian house hotel although not all confirmed would love to be a fly on wall back in the day some very beautiful ornate decor on the ground and upper ground floor we wondered about the history as part of write up states you can very much feel the presence of lillie langtry especially in the theatre bar where she allegedly put on shows a very interesting property 
 friendly staff
 staff was wonderful location was perfect 
 the front desk staff was phenomenal super courteous wonderfully helpful finding directions arranging transportation giving information the bell hops were so professional too we didn t have to lug another suitcase once we arrived at the hotel felt very safe and well taken care of except for the horrible pull out bed mattress 
 the manager of the restaurant was excellent had eyes everywhere the room was small but it was a single room and for central london i was very happy with it really the bathroom was lovely easy walk to paddington station comfortable hotel 
 the location and price was great rooms in london are generally small so make sure you pay attention to which size room you pick if you book the smallest square footage room you will probably be disappointed with the size don t pre pay breakfast during check in for the first morning if you might be jet lagged it ends at  am and you probably will oversleep 
 the hotel was in a great location
 service for breakfast was excellent manuela especially staff was very responsive and that is becoming rare 
 the hotel was very old fashioned which you don t see alot these days it was designed nicely
 the bed was comfy the breakfast had a wide range to suite peoples taste the location could not have been better with bayswater tube station and queensway within easy walking distance most of all the staff were so kind and friendly nothing was to much trouble for them 
 very comfy bed and fantastic breakfast
 great location easy to get to using public transport and round the corner from hyde park 
 price location staff
 well presented entrance
 the location was convenient to buses and metro hyde park and kennsington gardens are right there the staff made up for a major inconvenience 
 large bathroom quiet air con it was a heat wave when we travelled free wifi handy phone to take with us with internet access usb and international adapters provided in convenient location staff were lovely 
 good air conditioning and comfortable bed 
 it was reasonably good lovely old building albeit the superior room is there standard room so a confusing play with words so it was a squeeze to walk around the bed we didn t have breakfast there at london hotel prices 
 the breakfast buffet was excellent staff attentive the staff overall were friendly and helpful 
 to be honest i was disgusted with the hotel my friend was too big for bed ad he s   and the bathroom was a joke tempted to ask for my money back 
 we were upgraded to another hotel as grand royale was having plumbing problems we were given transport and breakfast for each day of our stay 
 the hotel was in great location next to hyde park excellent reception lounge and bar area full of character and even a claim to have been bought for lily langtree to perform for her king immaculately clean room very comfortable and modern albeit rather small breakfast was included and was very good served in a beautiful dining room 
 extremely friendly staff very comfortable facilities many amenities in a very desirable area of london excellent breakfast
 convenient location near two tube station very close to the city and all main attractions the hotel is situated in a historical building that is well kept i stayed in delux single room for  nights the room is small but it has everything you need wifi is available in the room and is free of charge good value for money 
 old world decoration very friendly and helpful staff good breakfast good location for central line and hyde park 
 loved the afternoon tea every afternoon a staff would come bring chocolate to the room the underground was right across the street staff was nice and helpful with suggestions and i slept on a cot because there were  of us in a room and the cot was actually very comfy 
 i travelled with my wife on arrival we were not given the room that we had booked first night was not very comfortable but the management were very apologetic and very helpful thereafter 
 location is very good near  tube stops however rooms are super small tiny in fact and i was a single traveller in a normal room and have no idea how  people could fit 
 on this occasion i had a decent sized quiet room on the top floor the public rooms are very atmospheric with dark panelling stained glass and comfortable chairs 
 price per square meter foot has been in top three of places i have stayed room was  m by  m plus bathroom of the  x  total surface m 
 great breakfast good staff especially razavan at reception magnificant edwaridian common rooms and loby 
 the building is beautiful with so many wonderful period features the staff friendly and efficient and once the tubes had closed for the night it was wonderfully quiet on the lower ground floor super convenient for queensway tube station too i d definitely go back 
 breakfast buffet was great with the option to request a specific dish
 stayed for a single night to see a show st rate staff st rate service very helpful very welcoming easy access to hyde park which we strolled through to shop on kennisington high st on day  and then left the bags at the hotel after checkout the following day to visit oxford st queensway tube station is just on the next street

 location was good and room was clean and comfortable staff polite and welcoming 
 the location was wonderful near public transportation as well as within walking distance to several important tourist sites the public spaces inside the building registration lobby etc were absolutely fabulous just as beautiful as the pictures on their website that s why i picked this hotel in my price range all the hotel rooms in london were extremely small but the grand royale london hyde park had the gorgeous common areas that set it apart from the rest the rooms were clean the staff very nice and the breakfast was delicious 
 the hotel was conveniently close to hyde park where we liked to walk it was close to two tube stations bus route and taxi services a convenience store was close by the hotel is a lovely old london town house style and the reception hall and public areas i would describe as baronial the staff were attentive and polite and the lady on duty at reception was particularly thoughtful and kindly our room was very clean and tidy though rather small for two people that said we were quite comfortable 
 staff was very friendly and helpful and responded quickly to requests and questions the english breakfast was well stocked and a good value for the cost the history behind the hotel was interesting the lobby library and theater bar were beautifully decorated and took us back in time 
 good location and average price breakfast is nice 
 park across street bus and tube very close the hotel has a nice welcoming fruit basket with chocolates and wine coffee and tea supplied 
 the room was tastefully decorated and well appointed the facilities such as lighting and bathroom were excellent however it was slightly too small
 as it was my girlfriend s th birthday the reception staff very kindly gave us a free room upgrade to a shoebox sized room i can only assume our original room was the size of a matchbox a plus point was the free to use smart phone in the room although we didn t use it for fear of the cost involved if it was lost broken stolen while we were out and about 
 we stayed at the only magnificent suite in the hotel we loved the overdone heritage feel and big space both in the suite and bathroom we were  adults and one toddler in this suite breakfast was great as well and the location right next to hyde park and kensington gardens is perfect for kids mommies can go shopping on the westbourne grove 
  welcome service for honeymoon was so touched  luxurious atmosphere at reception area  close from the tube station 
 a lovely victorian hotel with original features and very friendly staff very clean did the business for a short stay in london excellent nights sleep

 the breakfast was very good the room includes a mobile with internet that you can use for free very usefull for google maps 
 it its a classic old hotel each room has a cell phone to use for calling abroad or using google maps among other things the theater bar was a good meeting place for after seeing a play
 we had a wonderful stay location is perfect the room was comfortable the staff was very kind and competent at any time the breakfast was really good and service was perfect 
 just by chance i hit upon a hotel with a history it appears to be a small hotel with an amazing story the lower floors have wonderful wood panelling and scultured wood over the doors and stained glass leaded windows the breakfast rooms have beautiful moulded ceilings however my single bedroom was ultra modern apparently edward th bought this house for his mistress lilly langtry and had a small theatre and bar installed which are very ornate and intimate the hotel is in an excellent position being near queensway tube station on the bayswater road and right opposite kensington gardens and about  minutes walk from the palace it took me  minutes to walk through the gardens and across hyde park passing the serpentine and rotten row to reach marble arch 
 even though there was a minor inconvenience on our arrival the staff went above and beyond in trying to accommodate us compliments to all staff they were courteous always willing to help with a smile on their faces and alston at the front desk deserves a thumbs up for his professional treatment and kindness i will recommend this hotel to family and friends i felt like i was in old london which was very special thanks to all the staff 
 the bedroom size and bathroom did not reflect the website in our opinion it was misrepresented beautiful building and foyer small rooms and bathroom
 the staff were friendly and helpful the location s amazing so near bayswater station and central to everything around the area very strategic also amazing decor in the hotel itself 
 handi the electronic guide was great i don t know how we would have seen so much without him a fabulous idea also thank you for acknowledging my daughter s birthday 
 i found the property incorrect for myself i have raised the concerns i had with the manager directly who has taken on concerns and feedback they have responded positively to feedback and been very professional i did not try the food at the hotel but did note the galaxy hot chocolate sachet in the room 
 bed was ok not great room really small staff very friendly i basically slept there and was out the whole day so it s quite expensive to just sleep and shower but generally a decent deal
 breakfast good staff very helpful location
 the location was excellent near plenty of bars restaurantshops coffee shops and two tube stations 
 bed was very confortable and the room was clean and modern
 fantastic building like staying in a little museum friendly helpful staff i liked the handy device in the room and the fact they had a spare plug converter for me 
 good location and some really good staff beautiful building with some lovely features 
 all the staff were very helpful and friendly nothing too much trouble the room was rather small but facilities were excellent fruit water biscuits etc
 the lobby is very nice and the proximity to both the queensway and bayswater tube stations cannot be beat 
 lovely style in the reception and lobby staff on front desk and porters were lovely very friendly 
 the rooms were very clean and comfortable especially for london where they tend to be rather small good value for money and very friend y and helpful staff 
 the assistance of arnor was a real pleasure throughout the staff at the front desk were also very pleasant 
 i took my students to that hotel and it was great very well located with plenty of affordable restaurants two good grocery stores and access to the subway system with two easy access to it there were lots of staff to assist you they were courteous and doing their best to accommodate our needs i will certainly go back again next time i have to stop in london 
 the staff were excellent and the location perfect for the sight seeing we wanted to do very close to two tube stations shops and places to eat 
 bathroom extremely clean and modern wifi was good and stable 
 location style history staff
 hotel staff were amazing although noisy in a morning lol but was a quiet hotel on whole 
 great character and location just off main road making it quiet
 my sister and i bought our parents a trip to london for christmas and we all went in the end of march we stayed at grand royal hyde park for  nights and enjoyed every minute of it the staff was lovely and always very helpful the breakfast buffet was amazing with heaps of different things to chose from and the dining area had such nice old london interior which is what we wanted for our stay the rooms had a more modern feel interior and the rooms were a bit small but since you re always out and about while being in london anyways it didn t bother us at all as long as you have a roof over your head and a bed to sleep in we re a ok the hotel is basically across the street from hyde park and only  min walk to queens way underground which easy takes you where ever you want around london very centred perfect spot if you want to live close to basically everything so yeah definitely a place we would all return to a really nice hotel for such a decent price which is hard to find so centred in london in general awesome staff and service great breakfast and a really nice bar downstairs by the lobby for afternoon drinks before heading out for the evening will definitely return 
 it is relatively nice hotel rather typical interior for london based hotels room was fair and wifi worked very well hyde park is close which is a big plus 
 the rooms were clean and comfortable the breakfast is outstanding and an excellent value the staff was very helpful and accommodating the lobby bar and sitting room are absolutely beautiful and very interesting 
 great location room we were in was quite small but many larger rooms available lovely location just a moment from hyde park and close to transportation by bus and the undeground hotel is vintage but is in excellent shape staff was very helpful and friendly and services top notch 
 the staff we excellent hiral went above and beyond for our birthday easter trip chocolates wine cake an egg hunt we won and then a lovely complimentary drink in the theatre bar it was the loveliest atmosphere

 location was good
 staff couldnt do enough for you fantastic breakfast very clean perfect for an overnight or short break 
 clean hotel and very closed to the hyde park and the shops walking distance to two metro stations staff are very nice and keen to help
 the location of property close to all restaurants and transport into city

 bed very comfy location good for our purpose
 the hotel more than met our requirements for our  night stay we had booked a deluxe triple deluxe double room for our family of  as it states in the blurb the rooms are described as compact and our double was just that but we did not find this an issue and found the room to be comfortable modern and clean the bathroom looked new with modern fittings a lovely shower with an adjustable wall mounted head rainfall overhead fitting we also had ample tea coffee supplies bottled water biscuits and a selection of fresh fruit the reception and public rooms have been tastefully restored and give the hotel real character all the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful finally the location is a real bonus as there are  tube stops within  minutes walk hyde park is just across the road and there are numerous bus stops however if you don t mind a walk then the west end is about  minutes way on foot we also had a lovely surprise when we checked in as instead of the triple room we had booked we had been upgraded to the lily langtry suite which made our stay that extra bit special

 the room was tastefully furnished and very quiet i particularly appreciated the deep pile carpets and the individually controlled central heating in my room during the cold christmas period the windows were well insulated too not something to be taken for granted in england with kensington gardens literally  minute s walk away it was lovely to unwind after a busy day sightseeing with a walk in the park

 the plus point of this hotel is its location which is between two stations bays water and queensway there are lots of eateries and we are spoiled for choice 
 the beds very comfy but not enough room to move round kept hitting my toes on the bottom of the bed the staff were very helpful especially at breakfast as the big restaurant was closed and there was not enough room for everyone so we had to have our breakfast in the bar and it was not very warm overall we would go back again 
 the staff was excellent from the reception to the restaurant really rich breakfast

 the hotel is quaint the room tiny location is good overall satisfactory but pricey especially as no breakfast is included a continental breakfast would do

 i loved the location but my room was in the basement so i had a bad view of the bins wish i had been told i wouod get a nicer view in a different room bathrooms were clean and showers hot which was awesome 
 bed comfy nice breakfast 
 i actually live round the corner from this hotel and booked it as a birthday surprise for my sister and her fiance as a romantic break and a great way for us to catch up easily the following day not only did i book it at a greatly discounted price but they were so lovely to upgrade the couple to the beautiful lilly langtry suite my sister adores  poster beds and the only way to describe the suite is as magnificent and they also provided complimentary wine chocolates and a fruit basket they let me know the next day that the bar staff were also truly phenomenal friendly service as well as front of house with opulent decor and great drink prices i book and stay in a lot of hotels as an event planner and most definitely will be recommending this one to everyone and making sure that i get to stay myself one day soon 
 the hotel had maintenance issues and they transported me to an other hotel with an upgraded room and complimentary breakfast the sister hotel was nice modern and very quiet excellent location breakfast was good
 the location of this place is superb close to subway and hyde park the interior is very  s  s i love it 
 great place if you just want a convenient and cheap place for a night staff are excellent and very polite
 excellent customer service
 the location is great the down stairs bar is cosy 
 grand and historic hotel reasonable prices to stay in the most beautiful old building sitting rooms and bar were just beautiful friendly staff great location in central london quiet away from the hubbub but close to paddington notting hill and choice of two tubes a minute s walk away loved it 
 location and price were excellent
 staff couldn t do enough the hotel felt like a home and the breakfast was superb the location was perfect and the stay was best value i have ever had 
 nice staff lovely reception and comfy beds also brilliant location
 reception gives the impression that you are in an old english building 
 great location and the foyer area was lovely
 location and friendly staff
 the staff were friendly and helpful and the location made it very easy to travel around london 
 hotel architecture has a traditional english heritage charm which makes my stay feel authentic yet has modern facilities to ensure a pleasant stay room is new and clean though small there s a welcome basket of fruits and chocolates in the room which are appreciated hotel is conveniently located from kensington garden queensway and bayswater underground 
 location
 loved the location very close to two underground lines and hyde park 
 comfortable rooms in a very nice building 
 although we didn t encounter any problems or use the hotel facilities that much the check in service was prompt 
 the room had been recently renovated in a modern style we found it very attractive but it might disappoint others if they were looking for the victorian style of the public areas these were beautifully ornate with dark paneling and decorated ceilings the one way street was residential with large well maintained victorian houses now mostly flats it was very quiet a range of local food shops and restaurants was within easy walking distance along with a circle line underground station it was easy to travel to the theatre via the circle line we had booked room only so cannot comment on the food 
 the hotel is very beautiful it has an amazing antique reception and hall the entire experience was great the staff was very helpful the hotel manager was very welcoming on the day we arrived as he wrote a special note welcoming us i loved that personal touch yes central london is very expensive and the rooms aren t big but it s central london and when everything that one can possibly need is available without asking then nothing else matters the toilet even had a bath tub which was great a great experience and its just on the other side of the queensway station a  min walk and has many restaurants and supermarkets in the vicinity which is an added advantage totally worth it i recommend it strongly 
 location of the hotel it s decoration and specially the staff were very good
 the location was very good
 excellent bar very nice decor helpful staff great history to the building buffet was expensive but high quality very close to the underground tube 
 i liked the location it was in a nice quiet area yet central and close to the stations so getting around was easy the room was nice and cosy 
 the main hotel was poor we stayed at  inverness place which was good the staff was excellent particularly the receptionist and porter 
 location was great very near to a tube station and close to hyde park 
 location is awesome more restaurants nearby incldg indian and chinese very closeby to bayswater and queensway station a beautiful catholic church nearby nice ambience would love to be there again
 the lobby was period fashionable 
 fabulous decor in the public areas and excellent breakfast location very good for both tube queensway or bayswater and kemsington gardens 
 the the hotel is so uniqe i like how it looks like from the old movie in term decoration style yet it keeps it modern culture
 lovely breakfast in two beautiful rooms bedrooms are quite small but amenities all there 
 it was my rd time there they celebrated my birthday with a really nice big room chocolates bath robes and slippers had a lot of parcels coming everyday they ensured it s put inside the room location is superb stuff are reallyyyyy helpful and friendly
 we love this hotel for its atmosphere and friendliness we enjoyed a very good breakfast and service could not have been better bed was very comfortable and the pillows were unusually good which was much appreciated 
 confusion on arrival as it wasn t clear that i had to bring the same credit card as when i booked the hotel your staff made it difficult to understand what the problem was the system could be more flexible 
 the staff were helpful on the phone allowing my girlfriend access to the room before my arrival and payment for the room 
 the staff we re very welcoming friendly couldn t do enough the underground queensway was only a  min walk from the hotel definitely staying again 
 the place has a very good location surrounded by many facilities and well communicated the breakfast if booked early is worth just one complain they could have natural orange juice 
 friendly and helpful staff comfortable bed and room hotel was clean and quiet 
 amazing location very nice building in good area underground station nearby old but maintainted ok 
 location
 the building is stunning and the reception area and lounge were very fitting of the name checked in at about  o clock and our rooms were ready straight away despite usually having to wait until pm

 beautiful old building with lots of history attached to it along with very helpful friendly staff
 we actually got moved very last minute but it completely worked out for the better everyone was helpful and we got a bigger room extremely happy 
 shower screen very inadequate pointless in fact and bathroom was instantly flooded room marketed as deluxe double which frankly is ridiculous couldn t swing a cat it was clean however 
 the complimentary biscuits and hot chocolate you don t see a lot of those in hotels
 hotel location is excellent near two tube stations and kensington park staff were very friendly and helpful glad to see that they had a nice bar within the hotel for a nightcap 
 we asked for a room on higher floor via booking com but upon check in were given a ground floor immediately called and inquired on a top floor room staff brought our luggage upstairs and waited to see if we were pleased with the room location is on point and convenient to get around 
 location easy bus routes tube station room clean walkable to paddington 
 location was fantastic just a minute walk from the national history v a and science museums and even close to the royal albert hall 
 that after i saw my room and realizing that it was very small they gave me an upgrade for free
 the room service cleaning etc was good the hotel was clean bar staff good drinks expensive whiskey and coke and barcardi and coke was   well it is london i suppose reception staff good

 breakfast so much to choose from every taste catered for nothing too much trouble for the staff i asked for a fried egg for my husband and minutes later along came two 
 the location downstairs was beautifully decorated and the theatre bar was lovely 
 i have never stayed in a worse hotel room to small very dirty not to mention chipped glass and carpet no isinglass a trip hazard i would rate this hotel a  star not a five star i feel cheated of my money 
 location was ideal for our visit to winter wonderland 
 staff very friendly good location right beside hyde park and one minute walk from queensway tube station on the central line very clean rooms just a bit small 
 for our purpose the location was perfect everything was fine as usual for london the rooms are small this is as a rule compensated by generous lobbies and lounges which really makes sense as you only sleep in your room the bathroom was modern good design and clean 
 good location nearby parks and  minute walk to tube lots of stores and cafes around open late 
 nothing how on earth can this hotel be rated as a  star if it was not for this false rating i would never have booked this abysmal place

 this hotel did everything it could with the hand it was dealt the staff was very helpful and accommodating the room was well supplied reading lights and bedside tables on both sides nice bathroom with large towels window you could open fairly widely excellent free wi fi connection thoughtful tea tray tho we didn t use it the problem was that the room was so small we could not pass each other one had to hop on the bed for the other to walk around the room if you like to do calisthenics or yoga in your hotel room you will not be able to accomplish that in this room also in staying  days we were in need of another bar of soap but it never was supplied

 nice hotel with mostly friendly staff great location with fantastic access to hyde park and queensway tube  minutes walk away 
 we were transferred to their sister hotel the shaftsbury due to some problem with water supply to some of the rooms so this review is actually for that hotel we were given a very small room which had everything you needed and was clean and comfortable but it is just as well that we are smallish people and reasonably fit as the bed was right against the wall and one of us had to climb over the other to get in or out we were given free breakfast every day in compensation of the move which was greatly appreciated and the staff were all lovely the hotel is very close to both bayswater and queensway tube stations and to hyde park
