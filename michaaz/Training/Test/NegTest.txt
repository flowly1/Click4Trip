the price of the breakfast is a bit high if you compare it to the roomprice we went for breakfast in at cafe espresso on the burgasse  
 wi fi doesn t work well the breakfast is overpriced you have plenty of places to take it nearby
 the tram that goes in the street is really loud at night 
 the room does not fit four star category it could look a bit better and it could use some renovation
 the justification that our internet is not compatible with apple products is not the best statement in nowadays should definitely improve the internet connection at least for apple products
 room was incredibly hot with no apparent way to control temperature we had to sleep with window open which meant we woke up at about  
 a bit pricey
 the wifi signal was weak in my bedroom 
 the very noisy rooms even though we were to that we received a better upgraded room the windows were not phonic isolated the bathroom was very small and different from the pictures on the site in reality is not a  star hotel rather a  star hotel very expensive for the services offered the wifi connection in the room did not work the parking is very expensive  euro and is far away from the hotel  meters the rooms were old and with dirty floor carpet 
 the wifi reception was off and on especially in the dining room 
 expensive breakfast
 pillows were very uncomfortable and we had a bit of road noise with the windows closed 
 feels a little like an upmarket hostel which is fine but not quite what we d expected beds were very uncomfortable worst night s sleep i ve had in a hotel 
 the rooms where not easy to access
 i was disappointed by the fact that there was no opportunity to open the windows in my room
 our room was at first floor while i had told them i want it to be at upstairs when i reserved the hotel it was noisy as we can not sleep sometimes 
 several steps to climb down to access the elevators from the reception inconvenient if you have luggage to carry 
 the rooms have no air conditioning this was no problem during our stay but i can t imagine staying there when it is hot 
 the lady who checked us in on oct  was not very kind and welcome bad impression the hotel qualifies for  star not  the rooms are small though we booked double rooms for single use there was a bad smell in the room on the first night 
 having to log in username password for wifi each time you want to use it even after only  or so minutes after using it gets really annoying i can understand logging in once but not every time you use it 
 the room on the red side facing the road was quite noisy got up earlier than planned on a couple of days due to traffic noise
 hot water urn not hot enough to make tea sadly but expresso machine good 
 the bathtub is very dangerous slippery no rubber mat to avoid falling down breakfast way too expensive 
 we stayed in the summer the room didnt have air conditioning and the windows could be opened only a little
 there s no air con in the room and in the summer it was pretty warm though they did have a small fan which helped a little bit 
 wifi was horrible had an emergency business need for the wireless and it kept going up and down constantly for the  days bathroom was dirty as there was still hair in sink and tub breakfast is was very lacking 
 i didn t realize the hotel did not have air conditioning when i booked and we were there during the hot part of the summer but at least the large window opened which helped 
 double bed made out of twin beds so i always kind of fell inside the gap between the two mattresses 
 very hot rooms in summer internet connection is bad in rooms very noisy room no cleaning fridge was out of order
 we arrived in the morning but the room was not ready even at the official check in time the bathroom was dirty not cleaned after the previous guests
