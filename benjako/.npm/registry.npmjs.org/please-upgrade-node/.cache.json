a stacktrace \n\nIt's common for new Node users to miss the `npm` engines warning when installing a CLI. This package displays a beginner-friendly message if their Node version is below the one expected.\n\nExample with [hotel](https://github.com/typicode/hotel) CLI:\n\n```sh\n$ node -v\n0.12\n\n$ hotel\nhotel requires at least version 4 of Node, please upgrade\n```\n\n## Install\n\n```sh\nnpm install please-upgrade-node\n```\n\n```js\n#!/usr/bin/env node\nconst pkg = require('./package.json')\nrequire('please-upgrade-node')(pkg)\n// Must run BEFORE requiring other modules\n```\n\n```js\n// package.json\n{\n  \"bin\": \"./bin.js\",\n  \"engines\": { \"node\": \">=6\" }\n}\n```\n\n`>=` is the only operator supported by `please-upgrade-node` (e.g. `>=4`, `>=4.0`, `>=4.0.0`).\n\n## See also\n\n* [pkg-ok](https://github.com/typicode/pkg-ok) - :ok_hand: Prevents publishing a module with bad paths\n* [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) - :dog: Git hooks made easy\n* [update-notifier](https://github.com/yeoman/update-notifier) - Update notifications for your CLI app \n\nThanks to [zeit/serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve) for the error message inspiration.\n\n## License\n\nMIT - [Typicode :cactus:](https://github.com/typicode) - [Patreon](https://patreon.com/typicode)\n","maintainers":[{"name":"typicode","email":"typicode@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2018-04-25T22:24:49.825Z","created":"2017-07-08T14:23:22.809Z","1.0.0":"2017-07-08T14:23:22.809Z","1.0.1":"2017-07-10T11:08:07.928Z","2.0.0":"2017-07-24T20:18:56.200Z","3.0.0":"2017-07-31T20:31:08.419Z","3.0.1":"2017-07-31T20:52:03.914Z","3.0.2":"2018-04-25T22:24:46.352Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/typicode/please-upgrade-node#readme","keywords":["node","engines","version","check","verify","upgrade"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/typicode/please-upgrade-node.git"},"author":{"name":"typicode"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/typicode/please-upgrade-node/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"5ae10031-2eb6\"","_lastModified":"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 22:24:49 GMT"}
